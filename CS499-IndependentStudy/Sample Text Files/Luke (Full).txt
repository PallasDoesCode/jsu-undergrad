1:1 Inasmuch as 
many have taken in hand to set in order a narrative of those things which have been fulfilled among us,
1:2 just as 
those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us,
1:3  x
it seemed good to me also, 
x
having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, 
x
to write to you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus,
1:4  that
you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed.
1:5  x
There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah.
x
His wife [was] of the daughters of Aaron,
and
her name [was] Elizabeth.
1:6  And
they were both righteous before God, 
x
walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
1:7  But
they had no child,
because
Elizabeth was barren,
and
they were both well advanced in years.
1:8  So
it was,
that
while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,
1:9  x
according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot fell to burn incense 
when 
he went into the temple of the Lord.
1:10  And
the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense.
1:11  Then
an angel of the Lord appeared to him, 
x
standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
1:12  And
when 
Zacharias saw [him], 
x
he was troubled,
and
fear fell upon him.
1:13  But
the angel said to him,
x
"Do not be afraid, Zacharias,
for
your prayer is heard;
and
your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son,
and
you shall call his name John.
1:14  "And
you will have joy and gladness,
and
many will rejoice at his birth.
1:15  "For
he will be great in the sight of the Lord,
and
shall drink neither wine nor strong drink.
x
He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.
1:16  "And
he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.
1:17  x
"He will also go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah,
x
'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,'
and
the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, 
x
to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
1:18  And
Zacharias said to the angel,
x
"How shall I know this?
For
I am an old man,
and
my wife is well advanced in years."
1:19  And
the angel answered 
and 
said to him,
x
"I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God,
and
was sent to speak to you 
and 
bring you these glad tidings.
1:20  "But
behold, you will be mute 
and 
not able to speak 
until 
the day these things take place,
because
you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their own time."
1:21  And
the people waited for Zacharias,
and
marveled 
that 
he lingered so long in the temple.
1:22  But
when 
he came out, 
x
he could not speak to them;
and
they perceived 
that 
he had seen a vision in the temple,
for
he beckoned to them 
and 
remained speechless.
1:23  And
so it was,
as soon as 
the days of his service were completed,
that
he departed to his own house.
1:24  Now
after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived;
and
she hid herself five months, 
saying,
1:25  x
"Thus the Lord has dealt with me, in the days when He looked on [me], 
x
to take away my reproach among people."
1:26  Now
in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,
1:27  x
to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David.
x
The virgin's name [was] Mary.
1:28  And
having come in, 
x
the angel said to her,
x
"Rejoice, highly favored [one], 
x
the Lord [is] with you,
x
blessed [are] you among women!"
1:29  But
when 
she saw [him], 
x
she was troubled at his saying,
and
considered what manner of greeting this was.
1:30  Then
the angel said to her,
x
"Do not be afraid, Mary,
for
you have found favor with God.
1:31  "And
behold, you will conceive in your womb 
and 
bring forth a Son,
and
shall call His name JESUS.
1:32  x
"He will be great,
and
will be called the Son of the Highest;
and
the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David.
1:33  "And
He will reign over the house of Jacob forever,
and
of His kingdom there will be no end."
1:34  Then
Mary said to the angel,
x
"How can this be,
since
I do not know a man?"
1:35  And
the angel answered 
and 
said to her,
x
"The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
and
the power of the Highest will overshadow you;
therefore,
also,
that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.
1:36  "Now
indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age;
and
this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren.
1:37  "For
with God nothing will be impossible."
1:38  Then
Mary said,
x
"Behold the maidservant of the Lord!
x
Let it be to me according to your word."
And
the angel departed from her.
1:39  Now
Mary arose in those days 
and 
went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,
1:40  and
entered the house of Zacharias 
and 
greeted Elizabeth.
1:41  And
it happened,
when
Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary,
that
the babe leaped in her womb;
and
Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
1:42  Then
she spoke out with a loud voice 
and 
said,
x
"Blessed [are] you among women,
and
blessed [is] the fruit of your womb!
1:43  "But
why [is] this [granted] to me,
that
the mother of my Lord should come to me?
1:44  "For
indeed,
as soon as 
the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, 
x
the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
1:45  x
"Blessed [is] she who believed,
for
there will be a fulfillment of those things which were told her from the Lord."
1:46  And
Mary said,
x
"My soul magnifies the Lord,
1:47  And
my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
1:48  For
He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant;
For
behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed.
1:49  For
He who is mighty has done great things for me,
And
holy [is] His name.
1:50  And
His mercy [is] on those who fear Him From generation to generation.
1:51  x
He has shown strength with His arm,
x
He has scattered [the] proud in the imagination of their hearts.
1:52  x
He has put down the mighty from [their] thrones,
And
exalted [the] lowly.
1:53  x
He has filled [the] hungry with good things,
And
[the] rich He has sent away empty.
1:54  x
He has helped His servant Israel, In remembrance of [His] mercy,
1:55  As
He spoke to our fathers, To Abraham and to his seed forever."
1:56  And
Mary remained with her about three months,
and
returned to her house.
1:57  Now
Elizabeth's full time came for her to be delivered,
and
she brought forth a son.
1:58  When
her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had shown great mercy to her,
x
they rejoiced with her.
1:59  So
it was, on the eighth day,
that
they came to circumcise the child;
and
they would have called him by the name of his father, Zacharias.
1:60  x
His mother answered 
and said, 
x
"No he shall be called John."
1:61  But
they said to her,
x
"There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name."
1:62  So
they made signs to his father -- 
x
what he would have him called.
1:63  And
he asked for a writing tablet,
and
wrote, 
saying,
x
"His name is John."
So
they all marveled.
1:64  x
Immediately his mouth was opened 
and 
his tongue [loosed],
and
he spoke, 
x
praising God.
1:65  Then
fear came on all who dwelt around them;
and
all these sayings were discussed throughout all the hill country of Judea.
1:66  And
all those who heard [them] kept [them] in their hearts, 
saying,
x
"What kind of child will this be?"
And
the hand of the Lord was with him.
1:67  Now
his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit,
and
prophesied, 
saying,
1:68  x
"Blessed [is] the Lord God of Israel,
For
He has visited 
and 
redeemed His people,
1:69  And
has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of His servant David,
1:70  As
He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets, Who [have] [been] since the world began,
1:71  That
we should be saved from our enemies And from the hand of all who hate us,
1:72  x
To perform the mercy [promised] to our fathers 
And 
to remember His holy covenant,
1:73  x
The oath which He swore to our father Abraham,
1:74  x
To grant us 
that 
we, Being delivered from the hand of our enemies, 
x
Might serve Him without fear,
1:75  x
In holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.
1:76  "And
you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest;
For
you will go before the face of the Lord 
x
to prepare His ways,
1:77  x
To give knowledge of salvation to His people By the remission of their sins,
1:78  x
Through the tender mercy of our God, With which the Dayspring from on high has visited us,
1:79  x
To give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, 
x
To guide our feet into the way of peace."
1:80  So
the child grew 
and 
became strong in spirit,
and
was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation to Israel.
2:1  And
it came to pass in those days 
[that] 
a decree went out from Caesar Augustus 
that 
all the world should be registered.
2:2  x
This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria.
2:3  So
all went to be registered, everyone to his own city.
2:4  x
Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,
because
he was of the house and lineage of David,
2:5  x
to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child.
2:6  So
it was,
that
while they were there, 
x
the days were completed for her to be delivered.
2:7  And
she brought forth her firstborn Son,
and
wrapped Him in swaddling cloths,
and
laid Him in a manger,
because
there was no room for them in the inn.
2:8  Now
there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, 
x
keeping watch over their flock by night.
2:9  And
behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them,
and
the glory of the Lord shone around them,
and
they were greatly afraid.
2:10  Then
the angel said to them,
x
"Do not be afraid,
for
behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people.
2:11  "For
there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
2:12  "And
this [will] [be] the sign to you,
x
You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, 
x
lying in a manger."
2:13  And
suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and 
saying,
2:14  x
"Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace, goodwill toward men!"
2:15  So
it was,
when
the angels had gone away from them into heaven,
that
the shepherds said to one another,
x
"Let us now go to Bethlehem 
and 
see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us."
2:16  And
they came with haste 
and 
found Mary and Joseph,
and
the Babe lying in a manger.
2:17  Now
when 
they had seen [Him], 
x
they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child.
2:18  And
all those who heard [it] marveled at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
2:19  But
Mary kept all these things 
and 
pondered [them] in her heart.
2:20  Then
the shepherds returned, 
x
glorifying 
and 
praising God for all the things that they had heard 
and 
seen,
as
it was told them.
2:21  And
when 
eight days were completed for the circumcision of the Child, 
x
His name was called JESUS, 
x
the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.
2:22  Now
when 
the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were completed, 
x
they brought Him to Jerusalem 
x
to present [Him] to the Lord,
2:23  (as
it is written in the law of the Lord,
x
"Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the LORD")
2:24  and
to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, "A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons."
2:25  And
behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon,
and
this man was just 
and 
devout, 
x
waiting for the Consolation of Israel,
and
the Holy Spirit was upon him.
2:26  And
it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit 
that 
he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
2:27  So
he came by the Spirit into the temple.
And
when 
the parents brought in the Child Jesus, 
x
to do for Him according to the custom of the law,
2:28  x
he took Him up in his arms 
and 
blessed God 
and 
said,
2:29  x
"Lord,
now
You are letting Your servant depart in peace, According to Your word,
2:30  For
my eyes have seen Your salvation,
2:31  x
Which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,
2:32  x
A light to [bring] revelation to the Gentiles, And the glory of Your people Israel."
2:33  And
Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were spoken of Him.
2:34  Then
Simeon blessed them,
and
said to Mary His mother,
x
"Behold, this [Child] is destined for the fall 
and 
rising of many in Israel,
and
for a sign which will be spoken against,
2:35  x
"(yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also),
that
the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."
2:36  Now
there was one, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher.
x
She was of a great age,
and
had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,
2:37  and
this woman [was] a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple,
but
served [God] with fastings and prayers night and day.
2:38  And
coming in that instant 
x
she gave thanks to the Lord,
and
spoke of Him to all those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem.
2:39  So
when 
they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, 
x
they returned to Galilee, to their [own] city, Nazareth.
2:40  And
the Child grew 
and 
became strong in spirit, 
x
filled with wisdom;
and
the grace of God was upon Him.
2:41  x
His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.
2:42  And
when 
He was twelve years old, 
x
they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast.
2:43  When
they had finished the days,
as
they returned, 
x
the Boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem.
And
Joseph and His mother did not know [it];
2:44  but
supposing Him to have been in the company, 
x
they went a day's journey,
and
sought Him among [their] relatives and acquaintances.
2:45  So
when 
they did not find Him, 
x
they returned to Jerusalem, 
x
seeking Him.
2:46  Now
so it was 
[that] 
after three days they found Him in the temple, 
x
sitting in the midst of the teachers, 
x
both listening to them 
and 
asking them questions.
2:47  And
all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.
2:48  So
when 
they saw Him, 
x
they were amazed;
and
His mother said to Him,
x
"Son, why have You done this to us?
x
Look, 
x
Your father and I have sought You anxiously."
2:49  And
He said to them,
x
"Why did you seek Me?
x
Did you not know 
that 
I must be about My Father's business?"
2:50  But
they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them.
2:51  Then
He went down with them 
and 
came to Nazareth,
and
was subject to them,
but
His mother kept all these things in her heart.
2:52  And
Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
3:1  Now
in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
3:2  while
Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, 
x
the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
3:3  And
he went into all the region around the Jordan, 
x
preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins,
3:4  as
it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, 
saying,
x
"The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
x
'Prepare the way of the LORD,
x
Make His paths straight.
3:5  x
Every valley shall be filled 
And 
every mountain and hill brought low,
x
The crooked places shall be made straight 
And 
the rough ways smooth,
3:6  And
all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'"
3:7  Then
he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him,
x
"Brood of vipers!
x
Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
3:8  "Therefore
bear fruits worthy of repentance,
and
do not begin to say to yourselves,
x
'We have Abraham as [our] father.'
For
I say to you 
that 
God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
3:9  "And
even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees.
Therefore
every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down 
and 
thrown into the fire."
3:10  So
the people asked him, 
saying,
x
"What shall we do then?"
3:11  x
He answered 
and 
said to them,
x
"He who has two tunics, let him give to him who has none;
and
he who has food, let him do likewise."
3:12  Then
tax collectors also came to be baptized,
and
said to him,
x
"Teacher, what shall we do?"
3:13  And
he said to them,
x
"Collect no more than what is appointed for you."
3:14  Likewise
the soldiers asked him, 
saying,
x
"And
what shall we do?"
So
he said to them,
x
"Do not intimidate anyone 
or 
accuse falsely,
and
be content with your wages."
3:15  Now
as the people were in expectation,
and
all reasoned in their hearts about John,
whether
he was the Christ [or] not,
3:16  x
John answered, 
saying to all,
x
"I indeed baptize you with water;
but
One mightier than I is coming, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose.
x
He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
3:17  x
"His winnowing fan [is] in His hand,
and
He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor,
and
gather the wheat into His barn;
but
the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire."
3:18  And
with many other exhortations he preached to the people.
3:19  But
Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,
and
for all the evils which Herod had done,
3:20  also
added this, above all,
that
he shut John up in prison.
3:21  When
all the people were baptized, 
x
it came to pass 
that 
Jesus also was baptized;
and
while He prayed, 
x
the heaven was opened.
3:22  And
the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him,
and
a voice came from heaven which said,
x
"You are My beloved Son,
x
in You I am well pleased."
3:23  Now
Jesus Himself began [His] [ministry] [at] about thirty years of age, 
x
being (as was supposed) [the] son of Joseph, [the] [son] of Heli,
3:24  x
[the] [son] of Matthat, [the] [son] of Levi, [the] [son] of Melchi, [the] [son] of Janna, [the] [son] of Joseph,
3:25  x
[the] [son] of Mattathiah, [the] [son] of Amos, [the] [son] of Nahum, [the] [son] of Esli, [the] [son] of Naggai,
3:26  x
[the] [son] of Maath, [the] [son] of Mattathiah, [the] [son] of Semei, [the] [son] of Joseph, [the] [son] of Judah,
3:27  x
[the] [son] of Joannas, [the] [son] of Rhesa, [the] [son] of Zerubbabel, [the] [son] of Shealtiel, [the] [son] of Neri,
3:28  x
[the] [son] of Melchi, [the] [son] of Addi, [the] [son] of Cosam, [the] [son] of Elmodam, [the] [son] of Er,
3:29  x
[the] [son] of Jose, [the] [son] of Eliezer, [the] [son] of Jorim, [the] [son] of Matthat, [the] [son] of Levi,
3:30  x
[the] [son] of Simeon, [the] [son] of Judah, [the] [son] of Joseph, [the] [son] of Jonan, [the] [son] of Eliakim,
3:31  x
[the] [son] of Melea, [the] [son] of Menan, [the] [son] of Mattathah, [the] [son] of Nathan, [the] [son] of David,
3:32  x
[the] [son] of Jesse, [the] [son] of Obed, [the] [son] of Boaz, [the] [son] of Salmon, [the] [son] of Nahshon,
3:33  x
[the] [son] of Amminadab, [the] [son] of Ram, [the] [son] of Hezron, [the] [son] of Perez, [the] [son] of Judah,
3:34  x
[the] [son] of Jacob, [the] [son] of Isaac, [the] [son] of Abraham, [the] [son] of Terah, [the] [son] of Nahor,
3:35  x
[the] [son] of Serug, [the] [son] of Reu, [the] [son] of Peleg, [the] [son] of Eber, [the] [son] of Shelah,
3:36  x
[the] [son] of Cainan, [the] [son] of Arphaxad, [the] [son] of Shem, [the] [son] of Noah, [the] [son] of Lamech,
3:37  x
[the] [son] of Methuselah, [the] [son] of Enoch, [the] [son] of Jared, [the] [son] of Mahalalel, [the] [son] of Cainan,
3:38  x
[the] [son] of Enos, [the] [son] of Seth, [the] [son] of Adam, [the] [son] of God.
4:1  Then
Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, 
x
returned from the Jordan 
and 
was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
4:2  x
being tempted for forty days by the devil.
And
in those days He ate nothing,
and
afterward,
when
they had ended, 
x
He was hungry.
4:3  And
the devil said to Him,
"If
You are the Son of God, 
x
command this stone to become bread."
4:4  But
Jesus answered him, 
saying,
x
"It is written,
x
'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.'"
4:5  Then
the devil, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
4:6  And
the devil said to Him,
x
"All this authority I will give You, and their glory;
for
[this] has been delivered to me,
and
I give it to whomever I wish.
4:7  "Therefore,
if
You will worship before me, 
x
all will be Yours."
4:8  And
Jesus answered 
and 
said to him,
x
"Get behind Me, Satan!
For
it is written,
x
'You shall worship the LORD your God,
and
Him only you shall serve.'"
4:9  Then
he brought Him to Jerusalem, 
x
set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,
and
said to Him,
"If
You are the Son of God, 
x
throw Yourself down from here.
4:10  "For
it is written,
x
'He shall give His angels charge over you, 
x
To keep you,
4:11  "and,
'In their hands they shall bear you up,
Lest
you dash your foot against a stone.'"
4:12  And
Jesus answered 
and 
said to him,
x
"It has been said,
x
'You shall not tempt the LORD your God.'"
4:13  Now
when 
the devil had ended every temptation, 
x
he departed from Him until an opportune time.
4:14  Then
Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee,
and
news of Him went out through all the surrounding region.
4:15  And
He taught in their synagogues, 
x
being glorified by all.
4:16  So
He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up.
And
as His custom was, 
x
He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day,
and
stood up to read.
4:17  And
He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah.
And
when 
He had opened the book, 
x
He found the place where it was written,
4:18  x
"The Spirit of the LORD [is] upon Me,
Because
He has anointed Me To preach the gospel to [the] poor,
x
He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, 
x
To proclaim liberty to [the] captives 
And 
recovery of sight to [the] blind, 
x
To set at liberty those who are oppressed,
4:19  x
To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD."
4:20  Then
He closed the book,
and
gave [it] back to the attendant 
and 
sat down.
And
the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were fixed on Him.
4:21  And
He began to say to them,
x
"Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing."
4:22  So
all bore witness to Him,
and
marveled at the gracious words which proceeded out of His mouth.
And
they said,
x
"Is this not Joseph's son?"
4:23  x
He said to them,
x
"You will surely say this proverb to Me,
x
'Physician, heal yourself!
x
Whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, 
x
do also here in Your country.'"
4:24  Then
He said,
x
"Assuredly, I say to you, 
x
no prophet is accepted in his own country.
4:25  "But
I tell you truly, 
x
many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah,
when
the heaven was shut up three years and six months,
and
there was a great famine throughout all the land,
4:26  "but
to none of them was Elijah sent except to Zarephath, [in] [the] [region] of Sidon, to a woman [who] [was] a widow.
4:27  "And
many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet,
and
none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian."
4:28  So
all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,
4:29  and
rose up 
and 
thrust Him out of the city;
and
they led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built,
that
they might throw Him down over the cliff.
4:30  Then
passing through the midst of them, 
x
He went His way.
4:31  Then
He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee,
and
was teaching them on the Sabbaths.
4:32  And
they were astonished at His teaching,
for
His word was with authority.
4:33  Now
in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon.
And
he cried out with a loud voice,
4:34  x
saying,
x
"Let [us] alone!
x
What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth?
x
Did You come to destroy us?
x
I know who You are -- the Holy One of God!"
4:35  But
Jesus rebuked him, 
saying,
x

"Be quiet,
and
come out of him!"
And
when 
the demon had thrown him in [their] midst, 
x
it came out of him 
and 
did not hurt him.
4:36  Then
they were all amazed 
and 
spoke among themselves, 
saying,
x
"What a word this [is]!
For
with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits,
and
they come out."
4:37  And
the report about Him went out into every place in the surrounding region.
4:38  Now
He arose from the synagogue 
and 
entered Simon's house.
But
Simon's wife's mother was sick with a high fever,
and
they made request of Him concerning her.
4:39  So
He stood over her 
and 
rebuked the fever,
and
it left her.
And
immediately she arose 
and 
served them.
4:40  When
the sun was setting, 
x
all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him;
and
He laid His hands on every one of them 
and 
healed them.
4:41  And
demons also came out of many, 
crying out 
and 
saying,
x
"You are the Christ, the Son of God!"
And
He, rebuking [them], did not allow them to speak,
for
they knew 
that 
He was the Christ.
4:42  Now
when 
it was day, 
x
He departed 
and 
went into a deserted place.
And
the crowd sought Him 
and 
came to Him,
and
tried to keep Him from leaving them,
4:43  but
He said to them,
x
"I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also,
because
for this purpose I have been sent."
4:44  And
He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
5:1  So
it was,
as
the multitude pressed about Him to hear the word of God,
that
He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret,
5:2  and
saw two boats standing by the lake;
but
the fishermen had gone from them 
and 
were washing [their] nets.
5:3  Then
He got into one of the boats, which was Simon's,
and
asked him to put out a little from the land.
And
He sat down 
and 
taught the multitudes from the boat.
5:4  When
He had stopped speaking, 
x
He said to Simon,
x
"Launch out into the deep 
and 
let down your nets for a catch."
5:5  But
Simon answered 
and 
said to Him,
x
"Master, we have toiled all night 
and 
caught nothing;
nevertheless
at Your word I will let down the net."
5:6  And
when 
they had done this, 
x
they caught a great number of fish,
and
their net was breaking.
5:7  So
they signaled to [their] partners in the other boat to come 
and 
help them.
And
they came 
and 
filled both the boats,
so
that 
they began to sink.
5:8  When
Simon Peter saw [it], 
x
he fell down at Jesus' knees, 
saying,
x
"Depart from me,
for
I am a sinful man, O Lord!"
5:9  For
he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken,
5:10  and
so also [were] James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.
And
Jesus said to Simon,
x
"Do not be afraid.
x
From now on you will catch men."
5:11  So
when 
they had brought their boats to land, 
x
they forsook all 
and 
followed Him.
5:12  And
it happened 
when 
He was in a certain city,
that
behold, a man who was full of leprosy saw Jesus;
and
he fell on [his] face 
and 
implored Him, 
saying,
x
"Lord,
if
You are willing, 
x
You can make me clean."
5:13  Then
He put out [His] hand 
and 
touched him, 
saying,
x
"I am willing,
x
be cleansed."
x
Immediately the leprosy left him.
5:14  And
He charged him to tell no one,
"But
go 
and 
show yourself to the priest,
and
make an offering for your cleansing,
as
a testimony to them, just as Moses commanded."
5:15  However,
the report went around concerning Him all the more;
and
great multitudes came together to hear,
and
to be healed by Him of their infirmities.
5:16  So
He Himself [often] withdrew into the wilderness 
and 
prayed.
5:17  Now
it happened on a certain day,
as
He was teaching,
that
there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem.
And
the power of the Lord was [present] to heal them.
5:18  Then
behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, whom they sought to bring in 
and 
lay before Him.
5:19  And
when 
they could not find how they might bring him in,
because
of the crowd, they went up on the housetop 
and 
let him down with [his] bed through the tiling into the midst before Jesus.
5:20  When
He saw their faith, 
x
He said to him,
x
"Man, your sins are forgiven you."
5:21  And
the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, 
saying,
x
"Who is this who speaks blasphemies?
x
Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
5:22  But
when 
Jesus perceived their thoughts, 
x
He answered 
and 
said to them,
x
"Why are you reasoning in your hearts?
5:23  x
"Which is easier, to say,
x
'Your sins are forgiven you,'
or
to say,
x
'Rise up 
and 
walk'?
5:24  "But
that 
you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins" --  
x
He said to the man who was paralyzed,
x
"I say to you, 
x
arise, 
x
take up your bed,
and
go to your house."
5:25  x
Immediately he rose up before them, 
x
took up what he had been lying on,
and
departed to his own house, 
x
glorifying God.
5:26  And
they were all amazed,
and
they glorified God 
and 
were filled with fear, 
saying,
x
"We have seen strange things today!"
5:27  x
After these things He went out 
and 
saw a tax collector named Levi, 
x
sitting at the tax office.
And
He said to him,
x
"Follow Me."
5:28  So
he left all, 
x
rose up,
and
followed Him.
5:29  Then
Levi gave Him a great feast in his own house.
And
there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them.
5:30  And
their scribes and the Pharisees complained against His disciples, 
saying,
x
"Why do You eat 
and 
drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
5:31  x
Jesus answered 
and 
said to them,
x
"Those who are well have no need of a physician,
but
those who are sick.
5:32  x
"I have not come to call [the] righteous,
but
sinners, to repentance."
5:33  Then
they said to Him,
x
"Why do the disciples of John fast often 
and 
make prayers,
and
likewise those of the Pharisees,
but
Yours eat and drink?"
5:34  And
He said to them,
x
"Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them?
5:35  "But
the days will come
when 
the bridegroom will be taken away from them;
then
they will fast in those days."
5:36  Then
He spoke a parable to them,
x
"No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one;
otherwise
the new makes a tear,
and
also the piece that was [taken] out of the new does not match the old.
5:37  "And
no one puts new wine into old wineskins;
or
else the new wine will burst the wineskins 
and 
be spilled,
and
the wineskins will be ruined.
5:38  "But
new wine must be put into new wineskins,
and
both are preserved.
5:39  "And
no one, having drunk old [wine], immediately desires new;
for
he says,
x
'The old is better.'"
6:1  Now
it happened on the second Sabbath after the first 
that 
He went through the grainfields.
And
His disciples plucked the heads of grain 
and 
ate [them], 
x
rubbing [them] in [their] hands.
6:2  And
some of the Pharisees said to them,
x
"Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?"
6:3  But
Jesus answering them 
said,
x
"Have you not even read this, 
x
what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him,
6:4  x
"how he went into the house of God, 
x
took 
and 
ate the showbread,
and
also gave some to those with him, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat?"
6:5  And
He said to them,
x
"The Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath."
6:6  Now
it happened on another Sabbath,
also,
that
He entered the synagogue 
and t
aught.
And
a man was there whose right hand was withered.
6:7  So
the scribes and Pharisees watched Him closely,
whether
He would heal on the Sabbath,
that
they might find an accusation against Him.
6:8  But
He knew their thoughts,
and
said to the man who had the withered hand,
x
"Arise 
and 
stand here."
And
he arose 
and 
stood.
6:9  Then
Jesus said to them,
x
"I will ask you one thing,
x
Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good 
or 
to do evil, 
x
to save life 
or 
to destroy?"
6:10  And
when 
He had looked around at them all, 
x
He said to the man,
x
"Stretch out your hand."
And
he did so,
and
his hand was restored as whole as the other.
6:11  But
they were filled with rage,
and
discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.
6:12  Now
it came to pass in those days 
that 
He went out to the mountain 
x
to pray,
and
continued all night in prayer to God.
6:13  And
when 
it was day, 
x
He called His disciples to [Himself];
and
from them He chose twelve whom He also named apostles,
6:14  x
Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
6:15  x
Matthew and Thomas, James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot,
6:16  x
Judas [the] [son] of James, and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor.
6:17  And
He came down with them 
and 
stood on a level place with a crowd of His disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem,
and
from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him 
and 
be healed of their diseases,
6:18  as well as 
those who were tormented with unclean spirits.
And
they were healed.
6:19  And
the whole multitude sought to touch Him,
for
power went out from Him 
and 
healed [them] all.
6:20  Then
He lifted up His eyes toward His disciples,
and
said,
x
"Blessed [are] [you] poor,
For
yours is the kingdom of God.
6:21  x
Blessed [are] [you] who hunger now,
For
you shall be filled.
x
Blessed [are] [you] who weep now,
For
you shall laugh.
6:22  x
Blessed are you 
when 
men hate you,
And
when 
they exclude you,
And
revile [you],
and
cast out your name as evil, For the Son of Man's sake.
6:23  x
Rejoice in that day 
and 
leap for joy!
For
indeed your reward [is] great in heaven,
For
in like manner their fathers did to the prophets.
6:24  "But
woe to you who are rich,
For
you have received your consolation.
6:25  x
Woe to you who are full,
For
you shall hunger.
x
Woe to you who laugh now,
For
you shall mourn 
and 
weep.
6:26  x
Woe to you 
when 
all men speak well of you,
For
so did their fathers to the false prophets.
6:27  "But
I say to you who hear,
x
Love your enemies, 
x
do good to those who hate you,
6:28  x
"bless those who curse you,
and
pray for those who spitefully use you.
6:29  x
"To him who strikes you on the [one] cheek, 
x
offer the other also.
And
from him who takes away your cloak, 
x
do not withhold [your] tunic either.
6:30  x
"Give to everyone who asks of you.
And
from him who takes away your goods do not ask [them] back.
6:31  "And
just as 
you want men to do to you, 
x
you also do to them likewise.
6:32  "But
if 
you love those who love you, 
x
what credit is that to you?
For
even sinners love those who love them.
6:33  "And
if 
you do good to those who do good to you, 
x
what credit is that to you?
For
even sinners do the same.
6:34  "And
if 
you lend [to] [those] from whom you hope to receive back, 
x
what credit is that to you?
For
even 
sinners lend to sinners 
x
to receive as much back.
6:35  "But
love your enemies, 
x
do good,
and
lend, 
x
hoping for nothing in return;
and
your reward will be great,
and
you will be sons of the Most High.
For
He is kind to the unthankful and evil.
6:36  "Therefore
be merciful, 
just as 
your Father also is merciful.
6:37  x
"Judge not,
and
you shall not be judged.
x
Condemn not,
and
you shall not be condemned.
x
Forgive,
and
you will be forgiven.
6:38  x
"Give,
and
it will be given to you,
x
good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your bosom.
For
with the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you."
6:39  And
He spoke a parable to them,
x
"Can the blind lead the blind?
x
Will they not both fall into the ditch?
6:40  x
"A disciple is not above his teacher,
but
everyone who is perfectly trained will be like his teacher.
6:41  "And
why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye,
but
do not perceive the plank in your own eye?
6:42  "Or
how can you say to your brother,
x
'Brother, let me remove the speck that [is] in your eye,'
when
you yourself do not see the plank that [is] in your own eye?
x
Hypocrite!
x
First remove the plank from your own eye,
and
then you will see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brother's eye.
6:43  "For
a good tree does not bear bad fruit,
nor
does a bad tree bear good fruit.
6:44  "For
every tree is known by its own fruit.
For
[men] do not gather figs from thorns,
nor
do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.
6:45  x
"A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good;
and
an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil.
For
out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.
6:46  "But
why do you call Me 'Lord, Lord,'
and
do not do the things which I say?
6:47  x
"Whoever comes to Me,
and
hears My sayings 
and 
does them, 
x
I will show you whom he is like,
6:48  x
"He is like a man building a house, who dug deep 
and 
laid the foundation on the rock.
And
when 
the flood arose, 
x
the stream beat vehemently against that house,
and
could not shake it,
for
it was founded on the rock.
6:49  "But
he who heard and did nothing is like a man 
x
who built a house on the earth without a foundation, 
x
against which the stream beat vehemently;
and
immediately it fell.
And
the ruin of that house was great."
7:1  Now
when 
He concluded all His sayings in the hearing of the people, 
x
He entered Capernaum.
7:2  And
a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick 
and 
ready to die.
7:3  So
when 
he heard about Jesus, 
x
he sent elders of the Jews to Him, 
x
pleading with Him to come 
and 
heal his servant.
7:4  And
when 
they came to Jesus, 
x
they begged Him earnestly, 
x
saying that the one for whom He should do this was deserving,
7:5  "for
he loves our nation,
and
has built us a synagogue."
7:6  Then
Jesus went with them.
And
when 
He was already not far from the house, 
x
the centurion sent friends to Him, 
x
saying to Him,
x
"Lord, do not trouble Yourself,
for
I am not worthy 
that 
You should enter under my roof.
7:7  "Therefore
I did not even think myself worthy to come to You.
But
say the word,
and
my servant will be healed.
7:8  "For
I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me.
And
I say to one,
x
'Go,'
and
he goes;
and
to another, 'Come,'
and
he comes;
and
to my servant, 'Do this,'
and
he does [it]."
7:9  When
Jesus heard these things, 
x
He marveled at him,
and
turned around 
and 
said to the crowd that followed Him,
x
"I say to you, 
x
I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!"
7:10  And
those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well who had been sick.
7:11  Now
it happened, the day after,
[that]
He went into a city called Nain;
and
many of His disciples went with Him, and a large crowd.
7:12  And
when 
He came near the gate of the city, 
x
behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother;
and
she was a widow.
And
a large crowd from the city was with her.
7:13  When
the Lord saw her, 
x
He had compassion on her 
and 
said to her,
x
"Do not weep."
7:14  Then
He came 
and 
touched the open coffin,
and
those who carried [him] stood still.
And
He said,
x
"Young man, I say to you, 
x
arise."
7:15  So
he who was dead sat up 
and 
began to speak.
And
He presented him to his mother.
7:16  Then
fear came upon all,
and
they glorified God, 
saying,
x
"A great prophet has risen up among us";
and,
"God has visited His people."
7:17  And
this report about Him went throughout all Judea and all the surrounding region.
7:18  Then
the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things.
7:19  And
John, calling two of his disciples to [him], sent [them] to Jesus, 
saying,
x
"Are You the Coming One,
or
do we look for another?"
7:20  When
the men had come to Him, 
x
they said,
x
"John the Baptist has sent us to You, 
saying,
x
'Are You the Coming One,
or
do we look for another?'"
7:21  And
that very hour He cured many of infirmities, afflictions, and evil spirits;
and
to many blind He gave sight.
7:22  x
Jesus answered 
and 
said to them,
x
"Go 
and 
tell John the things you have seen 
and 
heard:
that
[the] blind see, 
x
[the] lame walk, 
x
[the] lepers are cleansed, 
x
[the] deaf hear, 
x
[the] dead are raised, 
x
[the] poor have the gospel preached to them.
7:23  "And
blessed is [he] who is not offended because of Me."
7:24  When
the messengers of John had departed, 
x
He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John,
x
"What did you go out into the wilderness to see?
x
A reed shaken by the wind?
7:25  "But
what did you go out to see?
x
A man clothed in soft garments?
Indeed
those who are gorgeously appareled 
and 
live in luxury are in kings' courts.
7:26  "But
what did you go out to see?
x
A prophet?
x
Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.
7:27  x
"This is [he] of whom it is written,
x
'Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You.'
7:28  "For
I say to you, among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist;
but
he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
7:29  And
when 
all the people heard [Him], 
even 
the tax collectors justified God, 
x
having been baptized with the baptism of John.
7:30  But
the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the will of God for themselves, 
x
not having been baptized by him.
7:31  And
the Lord said,
x
"To what then shall I liken the men of this generation,
and
what are they like?
7:32  x
"They are like children sitting in the marketplace 
and 
calling to one another, 
saying,
x
'We played the flute for you,

And
you did not dance,
x
We mourned to you,
And
you did not weep.'
7:33  "For
John the Baptist came 
neither 
eating bread 
nor 
drinking wine,
and
you say,
x
'He has a demon.'
7:34  x
"The Son of Man has come eating 
and 
drinking,
and
you say,
x
'Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
7:35  "But
wisdom is justified by all her children."
7:36  Then
one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him.
And
He went to the Pharisee's house,
and
sat down to eat.
7:37  And
behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner,
when
she knew 
that 
[Jesus] sat at the table in the Pharisee's house, 
x
brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil,
7:38  and
stood at His feet behind [Him] 
x
weeping;
and
she began to wash His feet with her tears,
and
wiped [them] with the hair of her head;
and
she kissed His feet 
and 
anointed [them] with the fragrant oil.
7:39  Now
when 
the Pharisee who had invited Him saw [this], 
x
he spoke to himself, 
saying,
if
"This man were a prophet, 
x
would know who and what manner of woman [this] [is] who is touching Him,
for
she is a sinner."
7:40  And
Jesus answered 
and 
said to him,
x
"Simon, I have something to say to you."
So
he said,
x
"Teacher, say it."
7:41  x
"There was a certain creditor who had two debtors.
x
One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
7:42  "And
when 
they had nothing with which to repay, 
x
he freely forgave them both.
x
Tell Me,
therefore,
which of them will love him more?"
7:43  x
Simon answered 
and 
said,
x
"I suppose the [one] whom he forgave more."
And
He said to him,
x
"You have rightly judged."
7:44  Then
He turned to the woman 
and 
said to Simon,
x
"Do you see this woman?
x
I entered your house,
x
you gave Me no water for My feet,
but
she has washed My feet with her tears 
and 
wiped [them] with the hair of her head.
7:45  x
"You gave Me no kiss,
but
this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet 
since 
the time I came in.
7:46  x
"You did not anoint My head with oil,
but
this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil.
7:47  "Therefore
I say to you, 
x
her sins, [which] [are] many, are forgiven,
for
she loved much.
But
to whom little is forgiven, 
x
[the] [same] loves little."
7:48  Then
He said to her,
x
"Your sins are forgiven."
7:49  And
those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves,
x
"Who is this who even forgives sins?"
7:50  Then
He said to the woman,
x
"Your faith has saved you.
x
Go in peace."
8:1  Now
it came to pass, afterward,
that
He went through every city and village, 
x
preaching 
and 
bringing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God.
And
the twelve [were] with Him,
8:2  and
certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities -- Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had come seven demons,
8:3  and
Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who provided for Him from their substance.
8:4  And
when 
a great multitude had gathered,
and
they had come to Him from every city, 
x
He spoke by a parable,
8:5  x
"A sower went out to sow his seed.
And
as he sowed, 
x
some fell by the wayside;
and
it was trampled down,
and
the birds of the air devoured it.
8:6  x
"Some fell on rock;
and
as soon as 
it sprang up, 
x
it withered away 
because 
it lacked moisture.
8:7  "And
some fell among thorns,
and
the thorns sprang up with it 
and 
choked it.
8:8  "But
others fell on good ground, 
x
sprang up,
and
yielded a crop a hundredfold."
When
He had said these things 
x
He cried,
x
"He who has ears to hear, 
x
let him hear!"
8:9  Then
His disciples asked Him, 
saying,
x
"What does this parable mean?"
8:10  And
He said,
x
"To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God,
but
to the rest [it] [is] [given] in parables,
that
'Seeing 
x
they may not see,
And
hearing 
x
they may not understand.'
8:11  "Now
the parable is this,
x
The seed is the word of God.
8:12  x
"Those by the wayside are the ones who hear;
then
the devil comes 
and 
takes away the word out of their hearts,
lest
they should believe 
and 
be saved.
8:13  "But
the ones on the rock [are] [those] who,
when
they hear, 
x
receive the word with joy;
and
these have no root, who believe for a while 
and 
in time of temptation fall away.
8:14  "Now
the ones [that] fell among thorns are those who,
when
they have heard, 
go out 
and 
are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life,
and
bring no fruit to maturity.
8:15  "But
the ones [that] fell on the good ground are those who, 
x
having heard the word with a noble and good heart, 
x
keep [it] 
and 
bear fruit with patience.
8:16  x
"No one,
when
he has lit a lamp, 
x
covers it with a vessel 
or 
puts [it] under a bed,
but
sets [it] on a lampstand,
that
those who enter may see the light.
8:17  "For
nothing is secret that will not be revealed,
nor
[anything] hidden that will not be known 
and 
come to light.
8:18  "Therefore
take heed how you hear.
For
whoever has, 
x
to him [more] will be given;
and
whoever does not have, 
x
even 
what he seems to have will be taken from him."
8:19  Then
His mother and brothers came to Him,
and
could not approach Him because of the crowd.
8:20  And
it was told Him [by] [some], who said,
x
"Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, 
x
desiring to see You."
8:21  But
He answered 
and 
said to them,
x
"My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God 
and 
do it."
8:22  Now
it happened, on a certain day,
that
He got into a boat with His disciples.
And
He said to them,
x
"Let us cross over to the other side of the lake."
And
they launched out.
8:23  But
as they sailed He fell asleep.
And
a windstorm came down on the lake,
and
they were filling [with] [water],
and
were in jeopardy.
8:24  And
they came to Him 
and 
awoke Him, 
saying,
x
"Master, Master, we are perishing!"
Then
He arose 
and 
rebuked the wind and the raging of the water.
And
they ceased,
and
there was a calm.
8:25  But
He said to them,
x
"Where is your faith?"
And
they were afraid,
and
marveled, 
x
saying to one another,
x
"Who can this be?
For
He commands even the winds and water,
and
they obey Him!"
8:26  Then
they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
8:27  And
when 
He stepped out on the land, 
x
there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time.
And
he wore no clothes,
nor
did he live in a house but in the tombs.
8:28  When
he saw Jesus, 
x
he cried out, 
x
fell down before Him,
and
with a loud voice said,
x
"What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?
x
I beg You, 
x
do not torment me!"
8:29  For
He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.
For
it had often seized him,
and
he was kept under guard, 
x
bound with chains and shackles;
and
he broke the bonds 
and 
was driven by the demon into the wilderness.
8:30  x
Jesus asked him, 
saying,
x
"What is your name?"
And
he said,
x
"Legion,"
because
many demons had entered him.
8:31  And
they begged Him 
that 
He would not command them to go out into the abyss.
8:32  Now
a herd of many swine was feeding there on the mountain.
So
they begged Him 
that 
He would permit them to enter them.
And
He permitted them.
8:33  Then
the demons went out of the man 
and 
entered the swine,
and
the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake 
and 
drowned.
8:34  When
those who fed [them] saw what had happened, 
x
they fled 
and 
told [it] in the city and in the country.
8:35  Then
they went out to see what had happened,
and
came to Jesus,
and
found the man from whom the demons had departed, 
x
sitting at the feet of Jesus, 
x
clothed and in his right mind.
And
they were afraid.
8:36  x
They also who had seen [it] told them by what means he who had been demon-possessed was healed.
8:37  Then
the whole multitude of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Him to depart from them,
for
they were seized with great fear.
And
He got into the boat 
and 
returned.
8:38  Now
the man from whom the demons had departed begged Him 
that 
he might be with Him.
But
Jesus sent him away, 
saying,
8:39  x
"Return to your own house,
and
tell what great things God has done for you."
And
he went his way 
and 
proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.
8:40  So
it was,
when
Jesus returned,
that
the multitude welcomed Him,
for
they were all waiting for Him.
8:41  And
behold, there came a man named Jairus,
and
he was a ruler of the synagogue.
And
he fell down at Jesus' feet 
and
begged Him to come to his house,
8:42  for
he had an only daughter about twelve years of age,
and
she was dying.
But
as He went, 
x
the multitudes thronged Him.
8:43  Now
a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her livelihood on physicians 
and 
could not be healed by any,
8:44  x
came from behind 
and 
touched the border of His garment.
And
immediately her flow of blood stopped.
8:45  And
Jesus said,
x
"Who touched Me?"
When
all denied it, 
x
Peter and those with him said,
x
"Master, the multitudes throng 
and 
press You,
and
You say,
x
'Who touched Me?'"
8:46  But
Jesus said,
x
"Somebody touched Me,
for
I perceived power going out from Me."
8:47  Now
when 
the woman saw 
that 
she was not hidden, 
x
she came trembling;
and
falling down before Him, 
x
she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him 
and 
how she was healed immediately.
8:48  And
He said to her,
x
"Daughter, be of good cheer,
x
your faith has made you well.
x
Go in peace."
8:49  While
He was still speaking, 
x
someone came from the ruler of the synagogue's [house], saying to him,

x
"Your daughter is dead.
x
Do not trouble the Teacher."
8:50  But
when 
Jesus heard [it], 
x
He answered him, 
saying,
x
"Do not be afraid;
x
only believe,
and
she will be made well."
8:51  When
He came into the house, 
x
He permitted no one to go in except Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl.
8:52  Now
all wept 
and 
mourned for her;
but
He said,
x
"Do not weep,
x
she is not dead,
but
sleeping."
8:53  And
they ridiculed Him, 
x
knowing 
that 
she was dead.
8:54  But
He put them all outside, 
x
took her by the hand 
and 
called, 
saying,
x
"Little girl, arise."
8:55  Then
her spirit returned,
and
she arose immediately.
And
He commanded 
that 
she be given [something] to eat.
8:56  And
her parents were astonished,
but
He charged them to tell no one what had happened.
9:1  Then
He called His twelve disciples together 
and 
gave them power and authority over all demons,
and
to cure diseases.
9:2  x
He sent them to preach the kingdom of God 
and 
to heal the sick.
9:3  And
He said to them,
x
"Take nothing for the journey, neither staffs nor bag nor bread nor money;
and
do not have two tunics apiece.
9:4  x
"Whatever house you enter, 
x
stay there,
and
from there depart.
9:5  "And
whoever will not receive you,
when
you go out of that city, 
x
shake off the very dust from your feet as a testimony against them."
9:6  So
they departed 
and 
went through the towns, 
x
preaching the gospel 
and 
healing everywhere.
9:7  Now
Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by Him;
and
he was perplexed,
because
it was said by some 
that 
John had risen from the dead,
9:8  and
by some that Elijah had appeared,
and
by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.
9:9  x
Herod said,
x
"John I have beheaded,
but
who is this of whom I hear such things?"
So
he sought to see Him.
9:10  And
when
the apostles had returned, 
x
told Him all that they had done.
Then
He took them 
and 
went aside privately into a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
9:11  But
when 
the multitudes knew [it], 
x
they followed Him;
and
He received them 
and 
spoke to them about the kingdom of God,
and
healed those who had need of healing.
9:12  When
the day began to wear away, 
x
the twelve came 
and 
said to Him,
x
"Send the multitude away,
that
they may go into the surrounding towns and country, 
and 
lodge 
and 
get provisions;
for
we are in a deserted place here."
9:13  But
He said to them,
x
"You give them something to eat."
And
they said,
x
"We have no more than five loaves and two fish,
unless
we go 
and 
buy food for all these people."
9:14  For
there were about five thousand men.
Then
He said to His disciples,
x
"Make them sit down in groups of fifty."
9:15  And
they did so,
and
made them all sit down.
9:16  Then
He took the five loaves and the two fish,
and
looking up to heaven, 
x
He blessed 
and 
broke [them],
and
gave [them] to the disciples 
x
to set before the multitude.

9:17  So
they all ate 
and 
were filled,
and
twelve baskets of the leftover fragments were taken up by them.
9:18  And
it happened,
as
He was alone praying,
[that]
His disciples joined Him,
and
He asked them, 
saying,
x
"Who do the crowds say that I am?"
9:19  So
they answered 
and 
said,
x
"John the Baptist,
but
some [say] Elijah;
and
others [say] 
that 
one of the old prophets has risen again."
9:20  x
He said to them,
"But
who do you say 
that 
I am?"
x
Peter answered 
and 
said,
x
"The Christ of God."
9:21  And
He strictly warned 
and commanded them to tell this to no one,
9:22  x
saying,
x
"The Son of Man must suffer many things,
and
be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes,
and
be killed,
and
be raised the third day."
9:23  Then
He said to [them] all,
"If
anyone desires to come after Me, 
x
let him deny himself,
and
take up his cross daily,
and
follow Me.
9:24  "For
whoever desires to save his life will lose it,
but
whoever loses his life for My sake will save it.
9:25  "For
what profit is it to a man 
if 
he gains the whole world,
and
is himself destroyed 
or 
lost?
9:26  "For
whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when 
He comes in His [own] glory, and [in] [His] Father's, and of the holy angels.
9:27  "But
I tell you truly, 
x
there are some standing here who shall not taste death 
till 
they see the kingdom of God."
9:28  Now
it came to pass, about eight days after these sayings,
that

He took Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray.
9:29  As
He prayed, 
x
the appearance of His face was altered,
and
His robe [became] white [and] glistening.
9:30  And
behold, two men talked with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,
9:31  x
who appeared in glory 
and 
spoke of His decease which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
9:32  But
Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep;
and
when 
they were fully awake, 
x
they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him.
9:33  Then
it happened,
as
they were parting from Him,
[that]
Peter said to Jesus,
x
"Master, it is good for us to be here;
and
let us make three tabernacles,
x
one for You, one for Moses,
and
one for Elijah" -- not knowing what he said.
9:34  While
he was saying this, 
x
a cloud came 
and 
overshadowed them;
and
they were fearful 
x
as they entered the cloud.
9:35  And
a voice came out of the cloud,
 saying,
x
"This is My beloved Son.
x
Hear Him!"
9:36  When
the voice had ceased, 
x
Jesus was found alone.
But
they kept quiet,
and
told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.
9:37  Now
it happened on the next day,
when
they had come down from the mountain,
that
a great multitude met Him.
9:38  x
Suddenly a man from the multitude cried out, 
saying,
x
"Teacher, I implore You, 
x
look on my son,
for
he is my only child.
9:39  "And
behold, a spirit seizes him,
and
he suddenly cries out,
x
it convulses him 
so that 
he foams [at] [the] [mouth],
and
it departs from him with great difficulty, 
x
bruising him.
9:40  "So
I implored Your disciples to cast it out,
but
they could not."
9:41  Then
Jesus answered 
and 
said,
x
"O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you 
and 
bear with you?
x
Bring your son here."
9:42  And
as he was still coming, 
x
the demon threw him down 
and 
convulsed [him].
Then
Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, 
x
healed the child,
and
gave him back to his father.
9:43  And
they were all amazed at the majesty of God.
But
while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did, 
x
He said to His disciples,
9:44  x
"Let these words sink down into your ears,
for
the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men."
9:45  But
they did not understand this saying,
and
it was hidden from them 
so that 
they did not perceive it;
and
they were afraid to ask Him about this saying.
9:46  Then
a dispute arose among them as to which of them would be greatest.
9:47  And
perceiving the thought of their heart, 
x
Jesus took a little child 
and 
set him by Him,
9:48  and
said to them,
x
"Whoever receives this little child in My name receives Me;
and
whoever receives Me 
x
receives Him who sent Me.
For
he who is least among you all will be great."
9:49  Now
John answered 
and 
said,
x
"Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name,
and
we forbade him 
because 
he does not follow with us."
9:50  But
Jesus said to him,
x
"Do not forbid [him],
for
he who is not against us is on our side."
9:51  Now
it came to pass,
when
the time had come for Him to be received up,
that
He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem,
9:52  and
sent messengers before His face.
And
as they went, 
x
they entered a village of the Samaritans, 
x
to prepare for Him.
9:53  But
they did not receive Him,
because
His face was [set] for the journey to Jerusalem.
9:54  And
when 
His disciples James and John saw [this], 
x
they said,
x
"Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven 
and 
consume them, just as Elijah did?"
9:55  But
He turned 
and 
rebuked them,
and
said,
x
"You do not know what manner of spirit you are of.
9:56  "For
the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives 
but 
to save [them]."
And
they went to another village.
9:57  Now
it happened 
as 
they journeyed on the road,
[that]
someone said to Him,
x
"Lord, I will follow You wherever You go."
9:58  And
Jesus said to him,
x
"Foxes have holes and birds of the air [have] nests,
but
the Son of Man has nowhere to lay [His] head."
9:59  Then
He said to another,
x
"Follow Me."
But
he said,
x
"Lord, let me first go 
and 
bury my father."
9:60  x
Jesus said to him,
x
"Let the dead bury their own dead,
but
you go 
and 
preach the kingdom of God."
9:61  And
another also said,
x
"Lord, I will follow You,
but
let me first go 
[and] 
bid them farewell who are at my house."
9:62  But
Jesus said to him,
x
"having put his hand to the plow,
and
looking back, 
x
No one is fit for the kingdom of God."
10:1  x
After these things the Lord appointed seventy others also,
and
sent them two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to go.
10:2  Then
He said to them,
x
"The harvest truly [is] great,
but
the laborers [are] few;
therefore
pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.
10:3  x
"Go your way,
x
behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.
10:4  x
"Carry neither money bag, knapsack, nor sandals;
and
greet no one along the road.
10:5  "But
whatever house you enter, 
x
first say,
x
'Peace to this house.'
10:6  "And
if 
a son of peace is there, 
x
your peace will rest on it;
if
not, it will return to you.
10:7  "And
remain in the same house, 
x
eating 
and 
drinking such things as they give,
for
the laborer is worthy of his wages.
x
Do not go from house to house.
10:8  x
"Whatever city you enter,
and
they receive you, 
x
eat such things as are set before you.
10:9  "And
heal the sick there,
and
say to them,
x
'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'
10:10  "But
whatever city you enter,
and
they do not receive you, 
x
go out into its streets 
and 
say,
10:11  x
'The very dust of your city which clings to us we wipe off against you.
Nevertheless
know this,
that
the kingdom of God has come near you.'
10:12  "But
I say to you 
that 
it will be more tolerable in that Day for Sodom than for that city.
10:13  x
"Woe to you, Chorazin!
x
Woe to you, Bethsaida!
For
if 
the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, 
x
they would have repented long ago, 
x
sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
10:14  "But
it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
10:15  "And
you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades.
10:16  x
"He who hears you hears Me,
x
he who rejects you rejects Me,
and
he who rejects Me 
x
rejects Him who sent Me."
10:17  Then
the seventy returned with joy, 
saying,
x
"Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name."
10:18  And
He said to them,
x
"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
10:19  x
"Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy,
and
nothing shall by any means hurt you.
10:20  "Nevertheless
do not rejoice in this,
that
the spirits are subject to you,
but
rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven."
10:21  x
In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit 
and 
said,
x
"I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
that
You have hidden these things from [the] wise and prudent 
and 
revealed them to babes.
for
Even so, Father, it seemed good in Your sight.
10:22  x
"All things have been delivered to Me by My Father,
and
no one knows who the Son is except the Father,
and
who the Father is except the Son,
and
[the] [one] to whom the Son wills to reveal [Him]."
10:23  Then
He turned to [His] disciples 
and 
said privately,
x
"Blessed [are] the eyes which see the things you see,
10:24  "for
I tell you 
x
that 
many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see,
and
have not seen [it],
and
to hear what you hear,
and
have not heard [it]."
10:25  And
behold, a certain lawyer stood up 
and 
tested Him, 
saying,
x
"Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
10:26  x
He said to him,
x
"What is written in the law?
x
What is your reading [of] [it]?"
10:27  So
he answered 
and 
said,
x
" 'You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,' and 'your neighbor as yourself.'"
10:28  And
He said to him,
x
"You have answered rightly,
x
do this 
and 
you will live."
10:29  But
he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus,
"And
who is my neighbor?"
10:30  Then
Jesus answered 
and 
said,
x
"A certain [man] went down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
and
fell among thieves, who stripped him of his clothing, 
x
wounded [him],
and
departed, 
x
leaving [him] half dead.
10:31  "Now
by chance a certain priest came down that road.
And
when 
he saw him, 
x
he passed by on the other side.
10:32  "Likewise
a Levite,
when
he arrived at the place, 
came 
and 
looked,
and
passed by on the other side.
10:33  "But
a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, 
x
came where he was.
And
when 
he saw him, 
x
he had compassion.
10:34  "So
he went to [him] 
and 
bandaged his wounds, 
x
pouring on oil and wine;
and
he set him on his own animal, 
x
brought him to an inn,
and
took care of him.
10:35  x
"On the next day,
when
he departed, 
x
he took out two denarii, 
x
gave [them] to the innkeeper,
and
said to him,
x
'Take care of him;
and
whatever more you spend,
when
I come again, 
x
I will repay you.'
10:36  "So
which of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves?"
10:37  And
he said,
x
"He who showed mercy on him."
Then
Jesus said to him,
x
"Go 
and 
do likewise."
10:38  Now
it happened as they went 
that 
He entered a certain village;
and
a certain woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house.
10:39  And
she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet 
and 
heard His word.
10:40  But
Martha was distracted with much serving,
and
she approached Him 
and 
said,
x
"Lord, do You not care 
that 
my sister has left me to serve alone?
Therefore
tell her 
x
to help me."
10:41  And
Jesus answered 
and 
said to her,
x
"Martha, Martha, you are worried 
and 
troubled about many things.
10:42  "But
one thing is needed,
and
Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her."
11:1  Now
it came to pass,
as
He was praying in a certain place,
when
He ceased,
[that]
one of His disciples said to Him,
x
"Lord, teach us to pray,
as
John also taught his disciples."
11:2  So
He said to them,
"When
you pray, 
say,
x
Our Father in heaven, 
x
Hallowed be Your name.
x
Your kingdom come.
x
Your will be done On earth 
as 
[it] [is] in heaven.
11:3  x
Give us day by day our daily bread.
11:4  And
forgive us our sins,
For
we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.
And
do not lead us into temptation,
But
deliver us from the evil one."
11:5  And
He said to them,
x
"Which of you shall have a friend,
and
go to him at midnight 
and 
say to him,
x
'Friend, lend me three loaves,
11:6  'for
a friend of mine has come to me on his journey,
and
I have nothing to set before him'
11:7  "and
he will answer from within 
and 
say,
x
'Do not trouble me,
x
the door is now shut,
and
my children are with me in bed,
x
I cannot rise 
and 
give to you'?
11:8  x
"I say to you,
though
he will not rise 
and 
give to him 
because 
he is his friend,
yet
because of his persistence he will rise 
and 
give him as many as he needs.
11:9  "So
I say to you,
ask,
and
it will be given to you,
x

seek,
and
you will find,
x
knock,
and
it will be opened to you.
11:10  "For
everyone who asks receives,
and
he who seeks finds,
and
to him who knocks it will be opened.
11:11  "If
a son asks for bread from any father among you, 
x
will he give him a stone?
Or
if 
[he] [asks] for a fish, 
x
will he give him a serpent instead of a fish?
11:12  "Or
if 
he asks for an egg, 
x
will he offer him a scorpion?
11:13  "If
you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, 
x
how much more will [your] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!"
11:14  And
He was casting out a demon,
and
it was mute.
So
it was,
when
the demon had gone out,
that
the mute spoke;
and
the multitudes marveled.
11:15  But
some of them said,
x
"He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons."
11:16  x
Others, testing [Him], sought from Him a sign from heaven.
11:17  But
He, knowing their thoughts, said to them,
x
"Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation,
and
a house [divided] against a house falls.
11:18  "If
Satan also is divided against himself, 
x
how will his kingdom stand?
Because
you say I cast out demons by Beelzebub.
11:19  "And
if 
I cast out demons by Beelzebub, 
x
by whom do your sons cast [them] out?
Therefore
they will be your judges.
11:20  "But
if 
I cast out demons with the finger of God, 
x
surely the kingdom of God has come upon you.
11:21  "When
a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, 
x
his goods are in peace.
11:22  "But
when 
a stronger than he comes upon him 
and 
overcomes him, 
x
he takes from him all his armor in which he trusted,
and
divides his spoils.
11:23  x
"He who is not with Me is against Me,
and
he who does not gather with Me scatters.
11:24  "When
an unclean spirit goes out of a man, 
x
he goes through dry places, 
x
seeking rest;
and
finding none, 
x
he says,
x
'I will return to my house from which I came.'
11:25  "And
when 
he comes, 
x
he finds [it] swept 
and 
put in order.
11:26  "Then
he goes 
and 
takes with [him] seven other spirits more wicked than himself,
and
they enter 
and 
dwell there;
and
the last [state] of that man is worse than the first."
11:27  And
it happened,
as
He spoke these things,
that
a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice 
and 
said to Him,
x
"Blessed [is] the womb that bore You,
and
[the] breasts which nursed You!"
11:28  But
He said,
x
"More than that, blessed [are] those who hear the word of God 
and 
keep it!"
11:29  And
while 
the crowds were thickly gathered together, 
x
He began to say,
x
"This is an evil generation.
x
It seeks a sign,
and
no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
11:30  "For
as 
Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites,
so
also the Son of Man will be to this generation.
11:31  x
"The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation 
and 
condemn them,
for
she came from the ends of the earth 
x
to hear the wisdom of Solomon;

and
indeed a greater than Solomon [is] here.
11:32  x
"The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation 
and 
condemn it,
for
they repented at the preaching of Jonah;
and
indeed a greater than Jonah [is] here.
11:33  x
"No one,
when
he has lit a lamp, 
x
puts [it] in a secret place or under a basket, but on a lampstand,
that
those who come in may see the light.
11:34  x
"The lamp of the body is the eye.
Therefore,
when
your eye is good, 
x
your whole body also is full of light.
But
when 
[your] [eye] is bad, 
x
your body also [is] full of darkness.
11:35  "Therefore
take heed 
that 
the light which is in you is not darkness.
11:36  "If
then 
your whole body [is] full of light, 
x
having no part dark, 
x
[the] whole [body] will be full of light,
as
when 
the bright shining of a lamp gives you light."
11:37  And
as He spoke, 
x
a certain Pharisee asked Him 
x
to dine with him.
So
He went in 
and 
sat down to eat.
11:38  When
the Pharisee saw [it], 
x
he marveled 
that 
He had not first washed before dinner.
11:39  Then
the Lord said to him,
"Now
you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and dish clean,
but
your inward part is full of greed and wickedness.
11:40  x
"Foolish ones!
x
Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?
11:41  "But
rather give alms of such things as you have;
then
indeed all things are clean to you.
11:42  "But
woe to you Pharisees!
For
you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs,
and
pass by justice and the love of God.
x
These you ought to have done, 
x
without leaving the others undone.
11:43  x
"Woe to you Pharisees!
For
you love the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.
11:44  x
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
For
you are like graves which are not seen,
and
the men who walk over [them] are not aware [of] [them]."
11:45  Then
one of the lawyers answered 
and 
said to Him,
x
"Teacher, by saying these things You reproach us also."
11:46  And
He said,
x
"Woe to you also, lawyers!
For
you load men with burdens hard to bear,
and
you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
11:47  x
"Woe to you!
For
you build the tombs of the prophets,
and
your fathers killed them.
11:48  x
"In fact, you bear witness 
that 
you approve the deeds of your fathers;
for
they indeed killed them,
and
you build their tombs.
11:49  "Therefore
the wisdom of God also said,
x
'I will send them prophets and apostles,
and
[some] of them they will kill 
and 
persecute,
11:50  "that
the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation,
11:51  x
"from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the temple.
x
Yes, I say to you, 
x
it shall be required of this generation.
11:52  x
"Woe to you lawyers!
For
you have taken away the key of knowledge.
x
You did not enter in yourselves,
and
those who were entering in you hindered."
11:53  And
as He said these things to them, 
x
the scribes and the Pharisees began to assail [Him] vehemently,
and
to cross-examine Him about many things,
11:54  x
lying in wait for Him,
and
seeking to catch Him in something He might say,
that
they might accuse Him.
12:1  x
In the meantime, when an innumerable multitude of people had gathered together,
so
that 
they trampled one another, 
x
He began to say to His disciples first [of] [all],
x
"Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
12:2  "For
there is nothing covered that will not be revealed,
nor
hidden that will not be known.
12:3  "Therefore
whatever you have spoken in the dark 
x
will be heard in the light,
and
what you have spoken in the ear in inner rooms 
x
will be proclaimed on the housetops.
12:4  "And
I say to you, My friends, 
x
do not be afraid of those who kill the body,
and
after that have no more that they can do.
12:5  "But
I will show you whom you should fear,
x
Fear Him who, after He has killed, has power to cast into hell,
x
yes, I say to you, 
x
fear Him!
12:6  x
"Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins?
And
not one of them is forgotten before God.
12:7  "But
the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
x
Do not fear therefore,
x
you are of more value than many sparrows.
12:8  "Also
I say to you, 
x
whoever confesses Me before men, him the Son of Man also will confess before the angels of God.
12:9  "But
he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
12:10  "And
anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, 
x
it will be forgiven him;
but
to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.
12:11  "Now
when 
they bring you to the synagogues and magistrates and authorities, 
x
do not worry about how or what you should answer, or what you should say.
12:12  "For
the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say."
12:13  Then
one from the crowd said to Him,
x
"Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
12:14  But
He said to him,
x
"Man, who made Me a judge or an arbitrator over you?"
12:15  And
He said to them,
x
"Take heed 
and 
beware of covetousness,
for
one's life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses."
12:16  Then
He spoke a parable to them, 
saying,
x
"The ground of a certain rich man yielded plentifully.
12:17  "And
he thought within himself, 
saying,
x
'What shall I do,
since
I have no room to store my crops?'
12:18  "So
he said,
x
'I will do this,
x
I will pull down my barns 
and 
build greater,
and
there I will store all my crops and my goods.
12:19  'And
I will say to my soul,
x
"Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years,
x
take your ease,
x
eat, 
x
drink,
[and]
be merry."'
12:20  "But
God said to him, 'Fool!
This night your soul will be required of you;
then
whose will those things be which you have provided?'
12:21  "So
[is] he who lays up treasure for himself,
and
is not rich toward God."
12:22  Then
He said to His disciples,
"Therefore
I say to you, 
x
do not worry about your life, 
x
what you will eat;
nor
about the body, what you will put on.
12:23  x
"Life is more than food,
and
the body [is] [more] than clothing.
12:24  x
"Consider the ravens,
for
they neither sow nor reap, which have neither storehouse nor barn;
and
God feeds them.
x
Of how much more value are you than the birds?
12:25  "And
which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?
12:26  "If
you then are not able to do [the] least, 
x
why are you anxious for the rest?
12:27  x
"Consider the lilies, 
x
how they grow,
x
they neither toil 
nor 
spin;
and
yet 
I say to you, 
x
even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
12:28  "If
then 
God so clothes the grass, which today is in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, 
x
how much more [will] [He] [clothe] you, O [you] of little faith?
12:29  "And
do not seek 
x
what you should eat 
or 
what you should drink,
nor
have an anxious mind.
12:30  "For
all these things the nations of the world seek after,
and
your Father knows 
that 
you need these things.
12:31  "But
seek the kingdom of God,
and
all these things shall be added to you.
12:32  x
"Do not fear, little flock,
for
it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
12:33  x
"Sell what you have 
and 
give alms,
x
provide yourselves money bags which do not grow old, 
x
a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, 
x
where no thief approaches 
nor 
moth destroys.
12:34  "For
where your treasure is, 
x
there your heart will be also.
12:35  x
"Let your waist be girded 
and 
[your] lamps burning,
12:36  "and
you yourselves be like men who wait for their master,
when
he will return from the wedding,
that
when he comes 
and 
knocks 
x
they may open to him immediately.
12:37  x
"Blessed [are] those servants whom the master,
when
he comes, 
x
will find watching.
x
Assuredly, I say to you 
that 
he will gird himself 
and 
have them sit down 
x
[to] [eat],
and
will come 
and 
serve them.
12:38  "And
if 
he should come in the second watch,
or
come in the third watch,
and
find [them] so, 
x
blessed are those servants.
12:39  "But
know this,
that
if 
the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, 
x
he would have watched 
and 
not allowed his house to be broken into.
12:40  "Therefore
you also be ready,
for
the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect."
12:41  Then
Peter said to Him,
x
"Lord, do You speak this parable [only] to us, or to all [people]?"
12:42  And
the Lord said,
x
"Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom [his] master will make ruler over his household, 
x
to give [them] [their] portion of food in due season?
12:43  x
"Blessed [is] that servant whom his master will find so doing 
when 
he comes.
12:44  x
"Truly, I say to you 
that 
he will make him ruler over all that he has.
12:45  "But
if 
that servant says in his heart,
x
'My master is delaying his coming,'
and
begins to beat the male and female servants,
and
to eat 
and 
drink 
and 
be drunk,
12:46  x
"the master of that servant will come on a day 
when 
he is not looking for [him],
and
at an hour when he is not aware,
and
will cut him in two 
and 
appoint [him] his portion with the unbelievers.
12:47  "And
that servant who knew his master's will,
and
did not prepare [himself] 
or 
do according to his will, 
x
shall be beaten with many [stripes].
12:48  "But
he who did not know,
yet
committed things deserving of stripes, 
x
shall be beaten with few.
For
everyone to whom much is given, 
x
from him much will be required;
and
to whom much has been committed, 
x
of him they will ask the more.
12:49  x
"I came to send fire on the earth,
and
how I wish 
x
it were already kindled!
12:50  "But
I have a baptism to be baptized with,
and
how distressed I am 
till 
it is accomplished!
12:51  x
"Do [you] suppose 
that 
I came to give peace on earth?
x
I tell you, not at all, but rather division.
12:52  "For
from now on five in one house will be divided, three against two, and two against three.
12:53  x
"Father will be divided against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."
12:54  Then
He also said to the multitudes,
"Whenever
you see a cloud rising out of the west, 
x
immediately you say,
x
'A shower is coming';
and
so it is.
12:55  "And
when 
you see the south wind blow, 
x
you say,
x
'There will be hot weather';
and
there is.
12:56  x
"Hypocrites!
You can discern the face of the sky and of the earth,
but
how [is] [it] 
x
you do not discern this time?
12:57  x
"Yes,
and
why, even of yourselves, do you not judge 
x
what is right?
12:58  "When
you go with your adversary to the magistrate, 
x
make every effort along the way 
x
to settle with him,
lest
he drag you to the judge, 
x
the judge deliver you to the officer,
and
the officer throw you into prison.
12:59  x
"I tell you, 
x
you shall not depart from there 
till 
you have paid the very last mite."
13:1  x
There were present at that season some who told Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

13:2  And
Jesus answered 
and 
said to them,
x
"Do you suppose 
that 
these Galileans were worse sinners than all [other] Galileans,
because
they suffered such things?
13:3  x
"I tell you, no;
but
unless 
you repent 
x
you will all likewise perish.
13:4  "Or
those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell 
and 
killed them, 
x
do you think 
that t
hey were worse sinners than all [other] men who dwelt in Jerusalem?
13:5  x
"I tell you, no;
but
unless 
you repent 
x
you will all likewise perish."
13:6  x
He also spoke this parable,
x
"A certain [man] had a fig tree planted in his vineyard,
and
he came seeking fruit on it 
and 
found none.
13:7  "Then
he said to the keeper of his vineyard,
x
'Look,
for
three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree 
and 
find none.
x
Cut it down,
x
why does it use up the ground?'
13:8  "But
he answered 
and 
said to him,
x
'Sir, let it alone this year also,
until
I dig around it 
and 
fertilize [it].
13:9  'And
if 
it bears fruit, [well].
But
if not, after that you can cut it down.'"
13:10  Now
He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
13:11  And
behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years,
and
was bent over 
and 
could in no way raise [herself] up.
13:12  But
when 
Jesus saw her, 
x
He called [her] to [Him] 
and 
said to her,
x
"Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity."
13:13  And
He laid [His] hands on her,
and
immediately she was made straight,
and
glorified God.
13:14  But
the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,
because
Jesus had healed on the Sabbath;
and
he said to the crowd,
x
"There are six days on which men ought to work;
therefore
come 
and 
be healed on them, and not on the Sabbath day."
13:15  x
The Lord then answered him 
and 
said, "Hypocrite!
Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or donkey from the stall,
and
lead [it] away 
x
to water it?
13:16  "So
ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound -- think of it ? for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?"
13:17  And
when 
He said these things, 
x
all His adversaries were put to shame;
and
all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by Him.
13:18  Then
He said,
x
"What is the kingdom of God like?
And
to what shall I compare it?
13:19  x
"It is like a mustard seed, which a man took 
and 
put in his garden;
and
it grew 
and 
became a large tree,
and
the birds of the air nested in its branches."
13:20  And
again He said,
x
"To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?
13:21  x
"It is like leaven, which a woman took 
and 
hid in three measures of meal 
till 
it was all leavened."
13:22  And
He went through the cities and villages, 
x
teaching,
and
journeying toward Jerusalem.
13:23  Then
one said to Him,
x
"Lord, are there few who are saved?"
And
He said to them,
13:24  x
"Strive to enter through the narrow gate,
for
many, I say to you, will seek to enter 
and 
will not be able.
13:25  "When
once the Master of the house has risen up 
and 
shut the door,
and
you begin to stand outside 
and 
knock at the door, 
saying,
x
'Lord, Lord, open for us,'
and
He will answer 
and 
say to you,
x
'I do not know you, 
x
where you are from,
13:26  "then
you will begin to say,
x
'We ate 
and 
drank in Your presence,
and
You taught in our streets.'
13:27  "But
He will say,
x
'I tell you 
x
I do not know you, 
x
where you are from.
x
Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity.'
13:28  x
"There will be weeping 
and 
gnashing of teeth,
when
you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God,
and yourselves thrust out.
13:29  x
"They will come from the east and the west, from the north and the south,
and
sit down in the kingdom of God.
13:30  "And
indeed there are last who will be first,
and
there are first who will be last."
13:31  x
On that very day some Pharisees came, 
x
saying to Him,
x
"Get out 
and 
depart from here,
for
Herod wants to kill You."
13:32  And
He said to them,
x
"Go, 
x
tell that fox,
x
'Behold, I cast out demons 
and 
perform cures today and tomorrow,
and
the third [day] I shall be perfected.'
13:33  "Nevertheless
I must journey today, tomorrow, and the [day] following;
for
it cannot be 
that 
a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.
13:34  x
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets 
and 
stones those who are sent to her!
x
How often I wanted to gather your children together,
as
a hen [gathers] her brood under [her] wings,
but
you were not willing!
13:35  x
"See!
Your house is left to you desolate;
and
assuredly, I say to you, 
x
you shall not see Me 
until 
[the] [time] comes 
when 
you say,
x
'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!'"
14:1  Now
it happened,
as
He went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees 
x
to eat bread on the Sabbath,
that
they watched Him closely.
14:2  And
behold, there was a certain man before Him who had dropsy.
14:3  And
Jesus, answering, 
x
spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, 
saying,
x
"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
14:4  But
they kept silent.
And
He took [him] 
and 
healed him,
and
let him go.
14:5  Then
He answered them, 
saying,
"having a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit, 
x
Which of you will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?"
14:6  And
they could not answer Him regarding these things.
14:7  So
He told a parable to those who were invited,
when
He noted how they chose the best places, 
x
saying to them,
14:8  "When
you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast, 
x
do not sit down in the best place,
lest
one more honorable than you be invited by him,
14:9  "and
he who invited you and him come 
and 
say to you,
x
'Give place to this man,'
and
then 
you begin with shame to take the lowest place.
14:10  "But
when 
you are invited, 
x
go 
and 
sit down in the lowest place,
so
that 
when 
he who invited you comes 
x
he may say to you,
x
'Friend, go up higher.'
Then
you will have glory in the presence of those who sit at the table with you.
14:11  "For
whoever exalts himself will be humbled,
and
he who humbles himself will be exalted."
14:12  Then
He also said to him who invited Him,
"When
you give a dinner or a supper, 
x
do not ask your friends, your brothers, your relatives, nor rich neighbors,
lest
they also invite you back,
and
you be repaid.
14:13  "But
when 
you give a feast, 
x
invite [the] poor, [the] maimed, [the] lame, [the] blind.
14:14  "And
you will be blessed,
because
they cannot repay you;
for
you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just."
14:15  Now
when 
one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things, 
x
he said to Him,
x
"Blessed [is] he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!"
14:16  Then
He said to him,
x
"A certain man gave a great supper 
and 
invited many,
14:17  "and
sent his servant at supper time 
x
to say to those who were invited,
x
'Come,
for
all things are now ready.'
14:18  "But
they all with one [accord] began to make excuses.
x
The first said to him,
x
'I have bought a piece of ground,
and
I must go 
and 
see it.
x
I ask you to have me excused.'
14:19  "And
another said,
x
'I have bought five yoke of oxen,
and
I am going to test them.
x
I ask you to have me excused.'
14:20  "Still
another said,
x
'I have married a wife,
and
therefore I cannot come.'
14:21  "So
that servant came 
and 
reported these things to his master.
Then
the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant,
x
'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city,
and
bring in here [the] poor and [the] maimed and [the] lame and [the] blind.'
14:22  "And
the servant said,
x
'Master, it is done 
as 
you commanded,
and
still there is room.'
14:23  "Then
the master said to the servant,
x
'Go out into the highways and hedges,
and
compel [them] to come in,
that
my house may be filled.
14:24  'For
I say to you 
that 
none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper.'"
14:25  Now
great multitudes went with Him.
And
He turned 
and 
said to them,
14:26  "If
anyone comes to Me 
and 
does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, 
x
he cannot be My disciple.
14:27  "And
whoever does not bear his cross 
and 
come after Me 
x
cannot be My disciple.
14:28  "For
which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first 
and 
count the cost,
whether
he has [enough] to finish [it] --
14:29  "lest,
after he has laid the foundation,
and
is not able to finish, 
x
all who see [it] begin to mock him,
14:30  x
"saying,
x
'This man began to build 
and 
was not able to finish.'
14:31  "Or
what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first 
and 
consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?
14:32  "Or
else,
while
the other is still a great way off, 
x
he sends a delegation 
and 
asks conditions of peace.
14:33  "So
likewise, 
whoever of you does not forsake all that he has cannot be My disciple.
14:34  x
"Salt [is] good;
but
if 
the salt has lost its flavor, 
x
how shall it be seasoned?
14:35  x
"It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill,
[but]
men throw it out.
x
He who has ears to hear, 
x
let him hear!"
15:1  Then
all the tax collectors and the sinners drew near to Him 
x
to hear Him.
15:2  And
the Pharisees and scribes complained, 
saying,
x
"This Man receives sinners 
and 
eats with them."
15:3  So
He spoke this parable to them, 
saying,
15:4  x
"What man of you, having a hundred sheep,
if
he loses one of them, 
x
does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness,
and
go after the one which is lost 
until 
he finds it?
15:5  "And
when 
he has found [it], 
x
he lays [it] on his shoulders, 
x
rejoicing.
15:6  "And
when 
he comes home, 
x
he calls together [his] friends and neighbors, 
x
saying to them,
x
'Rejoice with me,
for
I have found my sheep which was lost!'
15:7  x
"I say to you 
that 
likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents 
than 
over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.
15:8  "Or
what woman, having ten silver coins,
if
she loses one coin, 
x
does not light a lamp, 
x
sweep the house,
and
search carefully 
until 
she finds [it]?
15:9  "And
when 
she has found [it], 
x
she calls [her] friends and neighbors together, 
saying,
x
'Rejoice with me,
for
I have found the piece which I lost!'
15:10  "Likewise,
I say to you, 
x
there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."
15:11  Then
He said,
x
"A certain man had two sons.
15:12  "And
the younger of them said to [his] father,
x
'Father, give me the portion of goods that falls [to] [me].'
So
he divided to them [his] livelihood.
15:13  "And
not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, 
x
journeyed to a far country,
and
there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.
15:14  "But
when 
he had spent all, 
x
there arose a severe famine in that land,
and
he began to be in want.
15:15  "Then
he went 
and 
joined himself to a citizen of that country,
and
he sent him into his fields 
x
to feed swine.
15:16  "And
he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods that the swine ate,
and
no one gave him [anything].
15:17  "But
when 
he came to himself, 
x
he said,
x
'How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough 
and 
to spare,
and
I perish with hunger!
15:18  x
'I will arise 
and 
go to my father,
and
will say to him,
x
"Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,
15:19  "and
I am no longer worthy 
x
to be called your son.
x
Make me like one of your hired servants."'
15:20  "And
he arose 
and 
came to his father.
But
when 
he was still a great way off, 
x
his father saw him 
and 
had compassion,
and
ran 
and 
fell on his neck 
and 
kissed him.
15:21  "And
the son said to him,
x
'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight,
and
am no longer worthy to be called your son.'
15:22  "But
the father said to his servants,
x
'Bring out the best robe 
and 
put [it] on him,
and
put a ring on his hand and sandals on [his] feet.
15:23  'And
bring the fatted calf here 
and 
kill [it],
and
let us eat 
and 
be merry,
15:24  'for
this my son was dead 
and 
is alive again,
x
he was lost 
and 
is found.'
And
they began to be merry.
15:25  "Now
his older son was in the field.
And
as 
he came 
and 
drew near to the house, 
x
he heard music and dancing.
15:26  "So
he called one of the servants 
and 
asked 
x
what these things meant.
15:27  "And
he said to him,
x
'Your brother has come,
and
because 
he has received him safe and sound, 
x
your father has killed the fatted calf.'
15:28  "But
he was angry 
and 
would not go in.
Therefore
his father came out 
and 
pleaded with him.
15:29  "So
he answered 
and 
said to [his] father,
x
'Lo, these many years I have been serving you,
x
I never transgressed your commandment at any time;
and
yet you never gave me a young goat,
that
I might make merry with my friends.
15:30  'But
as soon as 
this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, 
x
you killed the fatted calf for him.'
15:31  "And
he said to him,
x
'Son, you are always with me,
and
all that I have is yours.
15:32  x
'It was right 
that 
we should make merry 
and 
be glad,
for
your brother was dead 
and 
is alive again,
and
was lost 
and 
is found.'"
16:1  x
He also said to His disciples,
x
"There was a certain rich man who had a steward,
and
an accusation was brought to him 
that 
this man was wasting his goods.
16:2  "So
he called him 
and 
said to him,
x
'What is this 
x
I hear about you?
x
Give an account of your stewardship,
for
you can no longer be steward.'
16:3  "Then
the steward said within himself,
x
'What shall I do?
For
my master is taking the stewardship away from me.
x
I cannot dig,
x
I am ashamed to beg.
16:4  x
'I have resolved 
x
what to do,
that
when 
I am put out of the stewardship, 
x
they may receive me into their houses.'
16:5  "So
he called every one of his master's debtors to [him],
and
said to the first,
x
'How much do you owe my master?'
16:6  "And
he said,
x
'A hundred measures of oil.'
So
he said to him,
x
'Take your bill,
and
sit down quickly 
and 
write fifty.'
16:7  "Then
he said to another,
'And
how much do you owe?'
So
he said,
x
'A hundred measures of wheat.'
And
he said to him,
x
'Take your bill,
and
write eighty.'
16:8  "So
the master commended the unjust steward 
because 
he had dealt shrewdly.
For
the sons of this world are more shrewd in their generation than the sons of light.
16:9  "And
I say to you, 
x
make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon,
that
when 
you fail, 
x
they may receive you into an everlasting home.
16:10  x
"He who [is] faithful in [what] [is] least is faithful also in much;
and
he who is unjust in [what] [is] least is unjust also in much.
16:11  "Therefore
if 
you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, 
x
who will commit to your trust the true [riches]?
16:12  "And
if 
you have not been faithful in what is another man's, 
x
who will give you what is your own?
16:13  x
"No servant can serve two masters;
for
either 
he will hate the one 
and  
love the other,
or
else 
he will be loyal to the one 
and  
despise the other.
x
You cannot serve God and mammon."
16:14  Now
the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things,
and
they derided Him.
16:15  And
He said to them,
x
"You are those who justify yourselves before men,
but
God knows your hearts.
For
what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.
16:16  x
"The law and the prophets [were] until John.
x
Since that time the kingdom of God has been preached,
and
everyone is pressing into it.
16:17  "And
it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away 
than 
for one tittle of the law to fail.
16:18  x
"Whoever divorces his wife 
and 
marries another 
x
commits adultery;
and
whoever marries her who is divorced from [her] husband 
x
commits adultery.
16:19  x
"There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen 
and 
fared sumptuously every day.
16:20  "But
there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, full of sores, who was laid at his gate,
16:21  x
"desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table.
Moreover
the dogs came 
and 
licked his sores.
16:22  "So
it was 
that 
the beggar died,
and
was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom.
x
The rich man also died 
and 
was buried.
16:23  "And
being in torments in Hades, 
x
he lifted up his eyes 
and 
saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
16:24  "Then
he cried 
and 
said,
x
'Father Abraham, have mercy on me,
and
send Lazarus 
that 
he may dip the tip of his finger in water 
and 
cool my tongue;
for
I am tormented in this flame.'
16:25  "But
Abraham said,
x
'Son, remember 
that 
in your lifetime you received your good things,
and
likewise Lazarus evil things;
but
now he is comforted 
and 
you are tormented.
16:26  'And
besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed,
so
that 
those who want to pass from here to you cannot,
nor
can those from there pass to us.'
16:27  "Then
he said,
x
'I beg you therefore, father,
that
you would send him to my father's house,
16:28  'for
I have five brothers,
that
he may testify to them,
lest
they also come to this place of torment.'
16:29  x
"Abraham said to him,
x
'They have Moses and the prophets,
x
let them hear them.'
16:30  "And
he said,
x
'No, father Abraham;
but
if 
one goes to them from the dead, 
x
they will repent.'
16:31  "But
he said to him,
'If
they do not hear Moses and the prophets,
neither
will they be persuaded 
though 
one rise from the dead.'"
17:1  Then
He said to the disciples,
x
"It is impossible 
that 
no offenses should come,
but
woe [to] [him] through whom they do come!
17:2  x
"It would be better for him 
if 
a millstone were hung around his neck,
and
he were thrown into the sea, 
than 
that 
he should offend one of these little ones.
17:3  x
"Take heed to yourselves.
If
your brother sins against you, 
x
rebuke him;
and
if 
he repents, 
x
forgive him.
17:4  "And
if 
he sins against you seven times in a day,
and
seven times in a day returns to you, 
saying,
x
'I repent,' 
x
you shall forgive him."
17:5  And
the apostles said to the Lord,
x
"Increase our faith."
17:6  So
the Lord said,
"If
you have faith as a mustard seed, 
x
you can say to this mulberry tree,
x
'Be pulled up by the roots 
and 
be planted in the sea,'
and
it would obey you.
17:7  "And
which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him 
when
 he has come in from the field,
x
'Come at once 
and 
sit down 
x
to eat'?
17:8  "But
will he not rather say to him,
x
'Prepare something for my supper,
and
gird yourself 
and 
serve me 
till 
I have eaten and drunk,
and
afterward you will eat 
and 
drink'?
17:9  x
"Does he thank that servant 
because 
he did the things that were commanded him?
x
I think not.
17:10  "So
likewise you, when you have done all those things which you are commanded, 
say,
x
'We are unprofitable servants.
x
We have done what was our duty to do.'"
17:11  Now
it happened 
as He went to Jerusalem 
that 
He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
17:12  Then
as He entered a certain village, 
x
there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off.
17:13  And
they lifted up [their] voices 
and 
said,
x
"Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
17:14  So
when 
He saw [them], 
x
He said to them,
x
"Go, 
x
show yourselves to the priests."
And
so it was 
that 
as they went, 
x
they were cleansed.
17:15  And
one of them, when he saw that he was healed, 
x
returned,
and
with a loud voice glorified God,
17:16  and
fell down on [his] face at His feet, 
x
giving Him thanks.
And
he was a Samaritan.
17:17  So
Jesus answered 
and 
said,
x
"Were there not ten cleansed?
But
where [are] the nine?
17:18  x
"Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?"
17:19  And
He said to him,
x
"Arise, 
x
go your way.
x
Your faith has made you well."
17:20  Now
when 
He was asked by the Pharisees 
when 
the kingdom of God would come, 
x
He answered them 
and 
said,
x
"The kingdom of God does not come with observation,
17:21  "nor
will they say,
x
'See here!'
or
'See there!'
For
indeed, the kingdom of God is within you."
17:22  Then
He said to the disciples,
x
"The days will come 
when 
you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man,
and
you will not see [it].
17:23  "And
they will say to you,
x
'Look here!'
or
'Look there!'
x
Do not go after [them] 
or 
follow [them].
17:24  "For
as the lightning that flashes out of one [part] under heaven shines to the other [part] under heaven,
so
also the Son of Man will be in His day.
17:25  "But
first He must suffer many things 
and 
be rejected by this generation.
17:26  "And
as it was in the days of Noah,
so
it will be also in the days of the Son of Man,
17:27  x
"They ate, 
x
they drank, 
x
they married wives, 
x
they were given in marriage,
until
the day that Noah entered the ark,
and
the flood came 
and 
destroyed them all.
17:28  "Likewise
as it was also in the days of Lot,
x
They ate, 
x
they drank, 
x
they bought, 
x
they sold, 
x
they planted, 
x
they built,
17:29  "but
on the day that Lot went out of Sodom 
x
it rained fire and brimstone from heaven 
and 
destroyed [them] all.
17:30  x
"Even so will it be in the day 
when 
the Son of Man is revealed.
17:31  x
"In that day, he who is on the housetop,
and
his goods [are] in the house, 
x
let him not come down to take them away.
And
likewise the one who is in the field, 
x
let him not turn back.
17:32  x
"Remember Lot's wife.
17:33  x
"Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it,
and
whoever loses his life 
x
will preserve it.
17:34  x
"I tell you, 
x
in that night there will be two [men] in one bed,
x
the one will be taken 
and 
the other will be left.
17:35  x
"Two [women] will be grinding together,
x
the one will be taken 
and 
the other left.
17:36  x
"Two [men] will be in the field,
x
the one will be taken 
and 
the other left."
17:37  And
they answered 
and 
said to Him,
x
"Where, Lord?"
So
He said to them,
"Wherever the body is, 
x
there the eagles will be gathered together."
18:1  Then
He spoke a parable to them,
that
men always ought to pray 
and 
not lose heart,
18:2  x
saying,
x
"There was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God 
nor 
regard man.
18:3  "Now
there was a widow in that city;
and
she came to him, 
saying,
x
'Get justice for me from my adversary.'
18:4  "And
he would not for a while;
but
afterward he said within himself,
'Though
I do not fear God 
nor 
regard man,
18:5  'yet
because this widow troubles me 
x
I will avenge her,
lest
by her continual coming 
x
she weary me.'"
18:6  Then
the Lord said,
x
"Hear what the unjust judge said.
18:7  "And
shall God not avenge His own elect who cry out day and night to Him,
though
He bears long with them?
18:8  x
"I tell you 
that 
He will avenge them speedily.
Nevertheless,
when
the Son of Man comes, 
x
will He really find faith on the earth?"
18:9  Also
He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves 
that 
they were righteous,
and
despised others,
18:10  x
"Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
18:11  x
"The Pharisee stood 
and 
prayed thus with himself,
x
'God, I thank You 
that 
I am not like other men -- extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.
18:12  x
'I fast twice a week,
x
I give tithes of all that I possess.'
18:13  "And
the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise [his] eyes to heaven,
but
beat his breast, 
saying,
x
'God, be merciful to me a sinner!'
18:14  x
"I tell you, 
x
this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other;
for
everyone who exalts himself will be humbled,
and
he who humbles himself will be exalted."
18:15  Then
they also brought infants to Him 
that 
He might touch them;
but
when 
the disciples saw [it], 
x
they rebuked them.
18:16  But
Jesus called them to [Him] 
and 
said,
x
"Let the little children come to Me,
and
do not forbid them;
for
of such is the kingdom of God.
18:17  x
"Assuredly, I say to you, 
x
whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it."
18:18  Now
a certain ruler asked Him, 
saying,
x
"Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
18:19  So
Jesus said to him,
x
"Why do you call Me good?
x
No one [is] good but One, [that] [is], God.
18:20  x
"You know the commandments,
x
'Do not commit adultery,'
x
'Do not murder,'
x
'Do not steal,'
x
'Do not bear false witness,'
x
'Honor your father and your mother.'"
18:21  And
he said,
x
"All these things I have kept from my youth."
18:22  So
when Jesus heard these things, 
x
He said to him,
x
"You still lack one thing.
x
Sell all that you have 
and 
distribute to the poor,
and
you will have treasure in heaven;
and
come, 
x
follow Me."
18:23  But
when 
he heard this, 
x
he became very sorrowful,
for
he was very rich.
18:24  And
when 
Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, 
x
He said,
x
"How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!
18:25  "For
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle 
than  
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
18:26  And
those who heard it said,
x
"Who then can be saved?"
18:27  But
He said,
x
"The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."
18:28  Then
Peter said,
x
"See, we have left all 
and 
followed You."
18:29  So
He said to them,
x
"Assuredly, I say to you, 
x
there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
18:30  x
"who shall not receive many times more in this present time,
and
in the age to come eternal life."
18:31  Then
He took the twelve aside 
and 
said to them,
x
"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem,
and
all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.
18:32  "For
He will be delivered to the Gentiles 
and 
will be mocked 
and 
insulted 
and 
spit upon.
18:33  x
"They will scourge [Him] 
and 
kill Him.
And
the third day He will rise again."
18:34  But
they understood none of these things,
x
this saying was hidden from them,
and
they did not know the things which were spoken.
18:35  Then
it happened,
as
He was coming near Jericho,
that
a certain blind man sat by the road begging.
18:36  And
hearing a multitude passing by, 
x
he asked what it meant.
18:37  So
they told him 
that 
Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
18:38  And
he cried out, 
saying,
x
"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
18:39  Then
those who went before warned him 
that 
he should be quiet;
but
he cried out all the more,
x
"Son of David, have mercy on me!"
18:40  So
Jesus stood still 
and
commanded him to be brought to Him.
And
when 
he had come near, 
x
He asked him,
18:41  x
saying,
x
"What do you want Me to do for you?"
x
He said,
x
"Lord,
that
I may receive my sight."
18:42  Then
Jesus said to him,
x
"Receive your sight,
x
your faith has made you well."
18:43  And
immediately he received his sight,
and
followed Him, 
x
glorifying God.
And
all the people,
when
they saw [it], 
x
gave praise to God.
19:1  Then
[Jesus] entered 
and 
passed through Jericho.
19:2  Now
behold, [there] [was] a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector,
and
he was rich.
19:3  And
he sought to see who Jesus was,
but
could not because of the crowd,
for
he was of short stature.
19:4  So
he ran ahead 
and 
climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him,
for
He was going to pass that [way].
19:5  And
when 
Jesus came to the place, 
x
He looked up 
and 
saw him,
and
said to him,
x
"Zacchaeus, make haste 
and 
come down,
for
today I must stay at your house."
19:6  So
he made haste 
and 
came down,
and
received Him joyfully.
19:7  But
when 
they saw [it], 
x
they all complained, 
saying,
x
"He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner."
19:8  Then
Zacchaeus stood 
and 
said to the Lord,
x
"Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor;
and
if 
I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, 
x
I restore fourfold."
19:9  And
Jesus said to him,
x
"Today salvation has come to this house,
because
he also is a son of Abraham,
19:10  "for
the Son of Man has come to seek 
and 
to save that which was lost."
19:11  Now
as they heard these things, 
x
He spoke another parable,
because
He was near Jerusalem 
and 
because 
they thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately.
19:12  Therefore
He said,
x
"A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom 
and 
to return.
19:13  "So
he called ten of his servants, 
x
delivered to them ten minas,
and
said to them,
x
'Do business 
till 
I come.'
19:14  "But
his citizens hated him,
and
sent a delegation after him, 
saying,
x
'We will not have this [man] to reign over us.'
19:15  "And
so it was 
that 
when 
he returned, 
x
having received the kingdom, 
then 
he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him,
that
he might know how much every man had gained by trading.
19:16  "Then
came the first, 
saying,
x
'Master, your mina has earned ten minas.'
19:17  "And
he said to him,
x
'Well [done], good servant;
because
you were faithful in a very little, 
x
have authority over ten cities.'
19:18  "And
the second came, 
saying,
x
'Master, your mina has earned five minas.'
19:19  "Likewise
he said to him,
x
'You also be over five cities.'
19:20  "Then
another came, 
saying,
x
'Master, here is your mina, which I have kept put away in a handkerchief.
19:21  'For
I feared you,
because
you are an austere man.
x
You collect 
x
what you did not deposit,
and
reap 
x
what you did not sow.'
19:22  "And
he said to him,
x
'Out of your own mouth I will judge you, [you] wicked servant.
x
You knew 
that 
I was an austere man, 
x
collecting what I did not deposit 
and 
reaping what I did not sow.
19:23  x
'Why then did you not put my money in the bank,
that
at my coming I might have collected it with interest?'
19:24  "And
he said to those who stood by,
x
'Take the mina from him,
and
give [it] to him who has ten minas.'
19:25  ("But
they said to him,
x
'Master, he has ten minas.')
19:26  'For
I say to you,
that
to everyone who has 
x
will be given;
and
from him who does not have, 
even 
what he has 
x
will be taken away from him.
19:27  'But
bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them,
and
slay [them] before me.'"
19:28  When
He had said this, 
x
He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
19:29  And
it came to pass,
when
He came near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mountain called Olivet,
[that]
He sent two of His disciples,
19:30  saying,
"Go into the village opposite [you], 
where 
as you enter 
x
you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat.
x
Loose it 
and 
bring [it] [here].
19:31  "And
if 
anyone asks you,
x
'Why are you loosing [it]?'
x
thus you shall say to him,
'Because
the Lord has need of it.'"
19:32  So
those who were sent went their way 
and 
found [it] 
just as 
He had said to them.
19:33  But

as they were loosing the colt, 
x
the owners of it said to them,
x
"Why are you loosing the colt?"
19:34  And
they said,
x
"The Lord has need of him."
19:35  Then
they brought him to Jesus.
And
they threw their own clothes on the colt,
and
they set Jesus on him.
19:36  And
as He went, 
x
[many] spread their clothes on the road.
19:37  Then,
as
He was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, 
x
the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice 
and 
praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen,
19:38  x
saying,
x
" 'Blessed [is] the King who comes in the name of the LORD!'
x
Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"
19:39  And
some of the Pharisees called to Him from the crowd,
x
"Teacher, rebuke Your disciples."
19:40  But
He answered 
and 
said to them,
x
"I tell you 
that 
if 
these should keep silent, 
x
the stones would immediately cry out."
19:41  Now
as 
He drew near, 
x
He saw the city 
and 
wept over it,
19:42  x
saying,
"If

you had known, even you, especially in this your day, the things [that] [make] for your peace!
But
now they are hidden from your eyes.
19:43  "For
days will come upon you 
when 
your enemies will build an embankment around you, 
x
surround you 
and 
close you in on every side,
19:44  "and
level you,
and
your children within you, to the ground;
and
they will not leave in you one stone upon another,
because
you did not know the time of your visitation."
19:45  Then
He went into the temple 
and 
began to drive out those who bought 
and 
sold in it,
19:46  x
saying to them,
x
"It is written,
x
'My house is a house of prayer,'
but
you have made it a 'den of thieves.'"
19:47  And
He was teaching daily in the temple.
But
the chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people sought to destroy Him,
19:48  and
were unable to do anything;
for
all the people were very attentive to hear Him.
20:1  Now
it happened on one of those days,
as
He taught the people in the temple 
and 
preached the gospel,
[that]
the chief priests and the scribes, together with the elders, confronted [Him]
20:2  and
spoke to Him, 
saying,
x
"Tell us, 
x
by what authority are You doing these things?
Or
who is he who gave You this authority?"
20:3  But
He answered 
and 
said to them,
x
"I also will ask you one thing,
and
answer Me,
20:4  x
"The baptism of John -- was it from heaven or from men?"
20:5  And
they reasoned among themselves, 
saying,
x
"If
we say,
x
'From heaven,' 
x
He will say,
x
'Why then did you not believe him?'
20:6  "But
if 
we say,
x
'From men,' 
x
all the people will stone us,
for
they are persuaded 
that 
John was a prophet."
20:7  So
they answered 
that 
they did not know where [it] [was] from.
20:8  And
Jesus said to them,
"Neither
will I tell you 
x
by what authority I do these things."
20:9  Then
He began to tell the people this parable,
x
"A certain man planted a vineyard, 
x
leased it to vinedressers,
and
went into a far country for a long time.
20:10  "Now
at vintage-time he sent a servant to the vinedressers,
that
they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard.
But
the vinedressers beat him 
and 
sent [him] away empty-handed.
20:11  "Again 
he sent another servant;
and
they beat him also, 
x
treated [him] shamefully,
and
sent [him] away empty-handed.
20:12  "And
again 
he sent a third;
and
they wounded him also 
and 
cast [him] out.
20:13  "Then
the owner of the vineyard said,
x
'What shall I do?
x
I will send my beloved son.
x
Probably they will respect [him] 
when 
they see him.'
20:14  "But
when 
the vinedressers saw him, 
x
they reasoned among themselves, 
saying,
x
'This is the heir.
x
Come, 
x
let us kill him,
that
the inheritance may be ours.'
20:15  "So
they cast him out of the vineyard 
and 
killed [him].
Therefore
what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
20:16  x
"He will come 
and 
destroy those vinedressers 
and 
give the vineyard to others."
And
when 
they heard [it] 
x
they said,
x
"Certainly not!"
20:17  Then
He looked at them 
and 
said,
x
"What then is this that is written,
x
'The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone'?
20:18  x
"Whoever falls on that stone will be broken;
but
on whomever it falls, 
x
it will grind him to powder."
20:19  And
the chief priests and the scribes that very hour sought to lay hands on Him,
but
they feared the people --
for
they knew 
x
He had spoken this parable against them.
20:20  So
they watched [Him],
and
sent spies who pretended to be righteous,
that
they might seize on His words, 
in order 
to deliver Him to the power and the authority of the governor.
20:21  Then
they asked Him, 
saying,
x
"Teacher, we know that You say 
and 
teach rightly,
and
You do not show personal favoritism,
but
teach the way of God in truth,
20:22  x
"Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
20:23  But
He perceived their craftiness,
and
said to them,
x
"Why do you test Me?
20:24  x
"Show Me a denarius.
x
Whose image and inscription does it have?"
x
They answered 
and 
said, 
x
"Caesar's."
And He said to them,
x
20:25  "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
20:26  But
they could not catch Him in His words in the presence of the people.
And
they marveled at His answer 
and 
kept silent.
20:27  Then
some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, came to [Him] 
and 
asked Him,
20:28  x
saying,
x
"Teacher, Moses wrote to us 
[that] 
if 
a man's brother dies, having a wife,
and
he dies without children, 
x
his brother should take his wife 
and 
raise up offspring for his brother.
20:29  "Now
there were seven brothers.
And
the first took a wife,
and
died without children.
20:30  "And
the second took her as wife,
and
he died childless.
20:31  "Then
the third took her,
and
in like manner the seven also;
and
they left no children,
and
died.
20:32  x
"Last of all the woman died also.
20:33  "Therefore,
in the resurrection, whose wife does she become?
For
all seven had her as wife."
20:34  And
Jesus answered 
and 
said to them,
x
"The sons of this age marry 
and 
are given in marriage.
20:35  "But
those who are counted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead,
neither
marry 
nor 
are given in marriage,
20:36  "nor
can they die anymore,
for
they are equal to the angels 
and 
are sons of God, 
x
being sons of the resurrection.
20:37  "But
even Moses showed in the [burning] bush [passage] 
that 
the dead are raised,
when
he called the Lord 'the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'
20:38  "For
He is not the God of the dead but of the living,
for
all live to Him."
20:39  Then
some of the scribes answered 
and 
said,
x
"Teacher, You have spoken well."
20:40  But
after that they dared not question Him anymore.
20:41  And
He said to them,
x
"How can they say 
that 
the Christ is the Son of David?
20:42  "Now
David himself said in the Book of Psalms,
x
'The LORD said to my Lord,
x
"Sit at My right hand,
20:43  Till 
I make Your enemies Your footstool."'
20:44  "Therefore
David calls Him 'Lord' 
x
how is He then his Son?"
20:45  Then,
in the hearing of all the people, 
x
He said to His disciples,
20:46  x
"Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts,
20:47  x
"who devour widows' houses,
and
for a pretense make long prayers.
x
These will receive greater condemnation."
21:1  And
He looked up 
and 
saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,
21:2  and
He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites.
21:3  So
He said,
x
"Truly I say to you 
that 
this poor widow has put in more than all,
21:4  "for
all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God,
but
she out of her poverty put in all the livelihood that she had."
21:5  Then,
as
some spoke of the temple, 
x
how it was adorned with beautiful stones and donations, 
x
He said,
21:6  x
"These things which you see -- the days will come in which not [one] stone shall be left upon another that shall not be thrown down."
21:7  So
they asked Him, 
saying,
x
"Teacher,
but
when will these things be?
And
what sign [will] [there] [be] 
when 
these things are about to take place?"
21:8  And
He said,
x
"Take heed 
that 
you not be deceived.
For
many will come in My name, 
saying,
x
'I am [He],'
and,
'The time has drawn near.'
Therefore
do not go after them.
21:9  "But
when 
you hear of wars and commotions, 
x
do not be terrified;
for
these things must come to pass first,
but
the end [will] [not] [come] immediately."
21:10  Then
He said to them,
x
"Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
21:11  "And
there will be great earthquakes in various places, and famines and pestilences;
and
there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.
21:12  "But
before all these things, they will lay their hands on you 
and 
persecute [you], 
x
delivering [you] up to the synagogues and prisons.
x
You will be brought before kings and rulers for My name's sake.
21:13  "But
it will turn out for you as an occasion for testimony.
21:14  "Therefore
settle [it] in your hearts not to meditate beforehand on what you will answer,
21:15  "for
I will give you a mouth and wisdom 
x
which all your adversaries will not be able to contradict 
or 
resist.
21:16  x
"You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, relatives and friends;
and
they will put [some] of you to death.
21:17  "And
you will be hated by all for My name's sake.
21:18  "But
not a hair of your head shall be lost.
21:19  x
"By your patience possess your souls.
21:20  "But
when 
you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies,
then
know 
that 
its desolation is near.
21:21  "Then
let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, 
x
let those who are in the midst of her depart,
and
let not those who are in the country enter her.
21:22  "For
these are the days of vengeance,
that
all things which are written may be fulfilled.
21:23  "But
woe to those who are pregnant 
and 
to those who are nursing babies in those days!
For
there will be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.
21:24  "And
they will fall by the edge of the sword,
and
be led away captive into all nations.
And
Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles 
until 
the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
21:25  "And
there will be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring,
21:26  x
"men's hearts failing them from fear 
and 
the expectation of those things which are coming on the earth,
for
the powers of heaven will be shaken.
21:27  "Then
they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
21:28  "Now
when 
these things begin to happen, 
look up 
and 
lift up your heads,
because
your redemption draws near."
21:29  Then
He spoke to them a parable,
x
"Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.
21:30  "When
they are already budding, 
you see 
and 
know for yourselves 
that 
summer is now near.
21:31  "So
you also,
when
you see these things happening, 
x
know 
x
that the kingdom of God is near.
21:32  x
"Assuredly, I say to you, 
x
this generation will by no means pass away 
till 
all things take place.
21:33  x
"Heaven and earth will pass away,
but
My words will by no means pass away.
21:34  "But
take heed to yourselves,
lest
your hearts be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life,
and
that Day come on you unexpectedly.
21:35  "For
it will come 
as 
a snare on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.
21:36  x
"Watch therefore,
and
pray always 
that 
you may be counted worthy 
x
to escape all these things 
that 
will come to pass,
and
to stand before the Son of Man."
21:37  And
in the daytime He was teaching in the temple,
but
at night He went out 
and 
stayed on the mountain called Olivet.
21:38  Then
early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple 
x
to hear Him.
22:1  Now
the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called Passover.
22:2  And
the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill Him,
for
they feared the people.
22:3  Then
Satan entered Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered among the twelve.
22:4  So
he went his way 
and 
conferred with the chief priests and captains, 
x
how he might betray Him to them.
22:5  And
they were glad,
and
agreed to give him money.
22:6  So
he promised 
and 
sought opportunity to betray Him to them in the absence of the multitude.
22:7  Then
came the Day of Unleavened Bread,
when
the Passover must be killed.
22:8  And
He sent Peter and John, 
saying,
x
"Go 
and 
prepare the Passover for us,
that
we may eat."
22:9  So
they said to Him,
x
"Where do You want us to prepare?"
22:10  And
He said to them,
x
"Behold,
when
you have entered the city, 
x
a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water,
x
follow him into the house which he enters.
22:11  "Then
you shall say to the master of the house,
x
'The Teacher says to you,
x
"Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?"'
22:12  "Then
he will show you a large, furnished upper room,
x
there make ready."
22:13  So
they went 
and 
found it 
just as 
He had said to them,
and
they prepared the Passover.
22:14  When
the hour had come, 
x
He sat down, and the twelve apostles with Him.
22:15  Then
He said to them,
x
"With [fervent] desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you 
x
before I suffer,
22:16  "for
I say to you, 
x
I will no longer eat of it 
until 
it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."
22:17  Then
He took the cup,
and
gave thanks,
and
said,
x
"Take this 
and 
divide [it] among yourselves,
22:18  "for
I say to you, 
x
I will not drink of the fruit of the vine 
until 
the kingdom of God comes."
22:19  And
He took bread, 
x
gave thanks 
and 
broke [it],
and
gave [it] to them, 
saying,
x
"This is My body which is given for you,
x
do this in remembrance of Me."
22:20  Likewise
He also [took] the cup after supper, 
saying,
x
"This cup [is] the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you.
22:21  "But
behold, the hand of My betrayer [is] with Me on the table.
22:22  "And
truly the Son of Man goes 
as 
it has been determined,
but
woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!"
22:23  Then
they began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.
22:24  Now
there was also a dispute among them,
as
to which of them should be considered the greatest.
22:25  And
He said to them,
x
"The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them,
and
those who exercise authority over them are called 'benefactors.' 
x
"But not so [among] you, 
22:26 on the contrary, 
he who is greatest among you, let him be as the younger,
and
he who governs 
as 
he who serves.
22:27  "For
who [is] greater, 
x
he who sits at the table,
or
he who serves?
x
[Is] it not he who sits at the table?
Yet
I am among you 
as 
the One who serves.
22:28  "But
you are those who have continued with Me in My trials.
22:29  "And
I bestow upon you a kingdom, 
just as 
My Father bestowed [one] upon Me,
22:30  "that
you may eat 
and 
drink at My table in My kingdom,
and
sit on thrones 
x
judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
22:31  And
the Lord said,
x
"Simon, Simon!
Indeed,
Satan has asked for you,
that
he may sift [you] as wheat.
22:32  "But
I have prayed for you,
that
your faith should not fail;
and
when 
you have returned to [Me], 
x
strengthen your brethren."
22:33  But
he said to Him,
x
"Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death."
22:34  Then
He said,
x
"I tell you, Peter, the rooster shall not crow this day before you will deny three times 
that 
you know Me."
22:35  And
He said to them,
"When
I sent you without money bag, knapsack, and sandals, 
x
did you lack anything?"
So
they said, "Nothing."
22:36  Then 
He said to them,
"But
now, he who has a money bag, 
x
let him take [it], and likewise a knapsack;
and
he who has no sword, 
x
let him sell his garment 
and 
buy one.
22:37  "For
I say to you 
that 
this which is written must still be accomplished in Me:
'And
He was numbered with the transgressors.'
For
the things concerning Me have an end."
22:38  So
they said,
x
"Lord, look, 
x
here [are] two swords."
And
He said to them,
x
"It is enough."
22:39  x
Coming out, 
x
He went to the Mount of Olives,
as
He was accustomed,
and
His disciples also followed Him.
22:40  When
He came to the place, ?x
He said to them,
x
"Pray that you may not enter into temptation."
22:41  And
He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw,
and
He knelt down 
and 
prayed,
22:42  x
saying,
x
"Father,
if
it is Your will, 
x
take this cup away from Me;
nevertheless
not My will,
but
Yours, be done."
22:43  Then
an angel appeared to Him from heaven, 
x
strengthening Him.
22:44  And
being in agony, 
x
He prayed more earnestly.
Then
His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
22:45  When
He rose up from prayer,
and
had come to His disciples, 
x
He found them sleeping from sorrow.
22:46  Then
He said to them,
x
"Why do you sleep?
x
Rise 
and 
pray,
lest
you enter into temptation."
22:47  And
while He was still speaking, 
x
behold, a multitude;
and
he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them 
and 
drew near to Jesus 
x
to kiss Him.
22:48  But
Jesus said to him,
x
"Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
22:49  When
those around Him saw what was going to happen, 
x
they said to Him,
x
"Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"
22:50  And
one of them struck the servant of the high priest 
and 
cut off his right ear.
22:51  But
Jesus answered 
and 
said,
x
"Permit even this."
And
He touched his ear 
and 
healed him.
22:52  Then
Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to Him,
x
"Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?
22:53  "When
I was with you daily in the temple, 
x
you did not try to seize Me.
But
this is your hour, and the power of darkness."
22:54  x
Having arrested Him, 
x
they led [Him] 
and 
brought Him into the high priest's house.
But
Peter followed at a distance.
22:55  Now
when 
they had kindled a fire in the midst of the courtyard 
and 
sat down together, 
x
Peter sat among them.
22:56  And
a certain servant girl, seeing him as he sat by the fire, looked intently at him and 
said,
x
"This man was also with Him."
22:57  But
he denied Him, 
saying,
x
"Woman, I do not know Him."
22:58  And
after a little while another saw him 
and 
said,
x
"You also are of them."
But
Peter said,
x
"Man, I am not!"
22:59  Then
after about an hour had passed, 
x
another confidently affirmed, 
saying,
x
"Surely this [fellow] also was with Him,
for
he is a Galilean."
22:60  But
Peter said,
x
"Man, I do not know what you are saying!"
x
Immediately,
while
he was still speaking, 
x
the rooster crowed.
22:61  And
the Lord turned 
and 
looked at Peter.
And
Peter remembered the word of the Lord, 
x
how He had said to him,
x
"Before the rooster crows, 
x
you will deny Me three times."
22:62  So
Peter went out 
and 
wept bitterly.
22:63  Now
the men who held Jesus mocked Him 
and 
beat Him.
22:64  And
having blindfolded Him, 
x
they struck Him on the face 
and 
asked Him, 
saying, 
x
"Prophesy!
Who is the one who struck You?"
22:65  And
many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him.
22:66  As soon as 
it was day, 
x
the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, came together 
and 
led Him into their council, 
saying,
22:67  "If
You are the Christ, 
x
tell us."
But
He said to them,
"If
I tell you, 
x
you will by no means believe.
22:68  "And
if 
I also ask [you], 
x
you will by no means answer Me 
or 
let [Me] go.
22:69  x
"Hereafter the Son of Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God."
22:70  Then
they all said,
x
"Are You then the Son of God?"
So
He said to them,
x
"You [rightly] say 
that 
I am."
22:71  And
they said,
x
"What further testimony do we need?
For
we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth."
23:1  Then
the whole multitude of them arose 
and 
led Him to Pilate.
23:2  And
they began to accuse Him, 
saying,
x
"We found this [fellow] perverting the nation,
and
forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, 
x
saying 
x
that 
He Himself is Christ, a King."
23:3  Then
Pilate asked Him, 
saying,
x
"Are You the King of the Jews?"
x
He answered him 
and 
said,
x
"It [is] 
[as] 
you say."
23:4  So
Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd,
x
"I find no fault in this Man."
23:5  But
they were the more fierce, 
saying,
x
"He stirs up the people, 
x
teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place."
23:6  When
Pilate heard of Galilee, 
x
he asked 
if 
the Man were a Galilean.
23:7  And
as soon as he knew 
that 
He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, 
x
he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
23:8  Now
when 
Herod saw Jesus, 
x
he was exceedingly glad;
for
he had desired for a long [time] 
x
to see Him,
because
he had heard many things about Him,
and
he hoped to see some miracle done by Him.
23:9  Then
he questioned Him with many words,
but
He answered him nothing.
23:10  And
the chief priests and scribes stood 
and 
vehemently accused Him.
23:11  Then
Herod, with his men of war, treated Him with contempt 
and 
mocked [Him], 
x
arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe,
and
sent Him back to Pilate.
23:12  x
That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other,
for
previously they had been at enmity with each other.
23:13  Then
Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,
23:14  x
said to them,
x
"You have brought this Man to me,
as
one who misleads the people.
And
indeed, having examined [Him] in your presence, 
x
I have found no fault in this Man concerning those things of which you accuse Him,
23:15  x
"no, neither did Herod,
for
I sent you back to him;
and
indeed nothing deserving of death has been done by Him.
23:16  x
"I will therefore chastise Him 
and 
release [Him]"
23:17  (for
it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast).
23:18  And
they all cried out at once, 
saying,
x
"Away with this [Man],
and
release to us Barabbas" --
23:19  who had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion made in the city,
and for murder.
23:20  therefore,
wishing to release Jesus, 
x
Pilate again called out to them.
23:21  But
they shouted, 
saying,
x
"Crucify [Him], 
x
crucify Him!"
23:22  Then
he said to them the third time,
x
"Why, 
x
what evil has He done?
x
I have found no reason for death in Him.
x
I will therefore chastise Him 
and 
let [Him] go."
23:23  But
they were insistent, 
x
demanding with loud voices 
that 
He be crucified.
And
the voices of these men and of the chief priests prevailed.
23:24  So
Pilate gave sentence 
that 
it should be as they requested.
23:25  And
he released to them the one they requested, who for rebellion and murder had been thrown into prison;
but
he delivered Jesus to their will.
23:26  Now
as 
they led Him away, 
x
they laid hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country,
and
on him they laid the cross 
that 
he might bear [it] after Jesus.
23:27  And
a great multitude of the people followed Him,
and
women who also mourned 
and 
lamented Him.
23:28  But
Jesus, turning to them, said,
x
"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me,
but
weep for yourselves and for your children.
23:29  "For
indeed the days are coming in which they will say,
x
'Blessed [are] the barren, 
x
wombs that never bore,
and
breasts which never nursed!'
23:30  "Then
they will begin 'to say to the mountains,
x
"Fall on us!"
and
to the hills,
x
"Cover us!"'
23:31  "For
if 
they do these things in the green wood, 
x
what will be done in the dry?"
23:32  x
There were also two others, criminals, led with Him 
x
to be put to death.
23:33  And
when 
they had come to the place called Calvary, 
x
there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.
23:34  Then
Jesus said,
x
"Father, forgive them,
for
they do not know what they do."
And
they divided His garments 
and 
cast lots.
23:35  And
the people stood looking on.
But
even 
the rulers with them sneered, 
saying,
x
"He saved others,
x
let Him save Himself 
if 
He is the Christ, the chosen of God."
23:36  x
The soldiers also mocked Him, 
x
coming 
and 
offering Him sour wine,
23:37  and
saying,
x
"If
You are the King of the Jews, 
x
save Yourself."
23:38  And
an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and
Hebrew,
x
THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
23:39  Then
one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, 
x
saying,
"If
You are the Christ, 
x
save Yourself and us."
23:40  But
the other, answering, rebuked him, 
x
saying,
x
"Do you not even fear God, 
x
seeing you are under the same condemnation?
23:41  "And
we indeed justly,
for
we receive the due reward of our deeds;
but
this Man has done nothing wrong."
23:42  Then
he said to Jesus,
x
"Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom."
23:43  And
Jesus said to him,
x
"Assuredly, I say to you, 
x
today you will be with Me in Paradise."
23:44  Now
it was about the sixth hour,
and
there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
23:45  Then
the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
23:46  And
when 
Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, 
x
He said,
x
"Father,
x
'into Your hands I commit My spirit.'"
x
Having said this, 
x
He breathed His last.
23:47  So
when 
the centurion saw what had happened, 
x
he glorified God, 
saying,
x
"Certainly this was a righteous Man!"
23:48  And
the whole crowd who came together to that sight, seeing what had been done, 
x
beat their breasts 
and 
returned.
23:49  But
all His acquaintances, and the women who followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, 
x
watching these things.
23:50  Now
behold, [there] [was] a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and just man.
23:51  x
He had not consented to their decision and deed.
x
[He] [was] from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God.
23:52  x
This man went to Pilate 
and 
asked for the body of Jesus.
23:53  Then
he took it down, 
x
wrapped it in linen,
and
laid it in a tomb [that] [was] hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever lain before.
23:54  x
That day was the Preparation,
and
the Sabbath drew near.
23:55  And
the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after,
and
they observed the tomb 
and 
how His body was laid.
23:56  Then
they returned 
and 
prepared spices and fragrant oils.
And
they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.
24:1  Now
on the first [day] of the week, very early in the morning, they, and certain [other] [women] with them, came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.
24:2  But
they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
24:3  Then
they went in 
and 
did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
24:4  And
it happened,
as
they were greatly perplexed about this,
that
behold, two men stood by them in shining garments.
24:5  Then,
as
they were afraid 
and 
bowed [their] faces to the earth, 
x
they said to them,
x
"Why do you seek the living among the dead?
24:6  x
"He is not here,
but
is risen!
x
Remember 
x
how He spoke to you 
when 
He was still in Galilee,
24:7  x
"saying,
x
'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men,
and
be crucified,
and
the third day rise again.'"
24:8  And
they remembered His words.
24:9  Then
they returned from the tomb 
and t
old all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
24:10  x
It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary [the] [mother] of James, and the other [women] with them, who told these things to the apostles.
24:11  And
their words seemed to them like idle tales,
and
they did not believe them.
24:12  But
Peter arose 
and 
ran to the tomb;
and
stooping down, 
x
he saw the linen cloths lying by themselves;

and
he departed, 
x
marveling to himself at what had happened.
24:13  Now
behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was seven miles from Jerusalem.
24:14  And
they talked together of all these things which had happened.
24:15  So
it was,
while
they conversed 
and 
reasoned,
that
Jesus Himself drew near 
and 
went with them.
24:16  But
their eyes were restrained,
x
so that they did not know Him.
24:17  And
He said to them,
x
"What kind of conversation [is] this that you have with one another as you walk and 
are sad?"
24:18  Then
the one whose name was Cleopas answered 
and 
said to Him,
x
"Are You the only stranger in Jerusalem,
and
have You not known the things which happened there in these days?"
24:19  And
He said to them,
x
"What things?"
So
they said to Him,
x
"The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a Prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,
24:20  "and
how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him 
x
to be condemned to death,
and
crucified Him.
24:21  "But
we were hoping 
that 
it was He who was going to redeem Israel.
X
Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened.
24:22  x
"Yes,
and
certain women of our company, who arrived at the tomb early, astonished us.
24:23  "When
they did not find His body, 
x
they came saying 
that 
they had also seen a vision of angels who said He was alive.
24:24  "And
certain of those [who] [were] with us went to the tomb 
and 
found [it] 
just as 
the women had said;
but
Him they did not see."
24:25  Then
He said to them,
x
"O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!
24:26  x
"Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things 
and 
to enter into His glory?"
24:27  And
beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.
24:28  Then
they drew near to the village where they were going,
and
He indicated 
that 
He would have gone farther.
24:29  But
they constrained Him, 
saying,
x
"Abide with us,
for
it is toward evening,
and
the day is far spent."
And
He went in to stay with them.
24:30  Now
it came to pass,
as
He sat at the table with them,
that
He took bread, 
x
blessed 
and 
broke [it],
and
gave it to them.
24:31  Then
their eyes were opened 
and 
they knew Him;
and
He vanished from their sight.
24:32  And
they said to one another,
x
"Did not our heart burn within us 
while 
He talked with us on the road,
and
while 
He opened the Scriptures to us?"
24:33  So
they rose up that very hour 
and 
returned to Jerusalem,
and
found the eleven 
and 
those [who] [were] with them gathered together,
24:34  x
saying,
x
"The Lord is risen indeed,
and
has appeared to Simon!"
24:35  And
they told about the things 
[that] 
[had] [happened] on the road,
and
how He was known to them in the breaking of bread.
24:36  Now
as they said these things, 
x
Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them,
and
said to them,
x
"Peace to you."
24:37  But
they were terrified 
and 
frightened,
and
supposed they had seen a spirit.
24:38  And
He said to them,
x
"Why are you troubled?
And
why do doubts arise in your hearts?
24:39  x
"Behold My hands and My feet,
that
it is I Myself.
x
Handle Me 
and 
see,
for
a spirit does not have flesh and bones 
as 
you see I have."
24:40  When
He had said this, 
x
He showed them His hands and His feet.
24:41  But
while they still did not believe for joy,
and
marveled, 
x
He said to them,
x
"Have you any food here?"
24:42  So
they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.
24:43  And
He took [it] 
and 
ate in their presence.
24:44  Then
He said to them,
x
"These [are] the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you,
that
all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and [the] Prophets and [the] Psalms concerning Me."
24:45  And
He opened their understanding,
that
they might comprehend the Scriptures.
24:46  Then
He said to them,
x
"Thus it is written,
and
thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer 
and 
to rise from the dead the third day,
24:47  "and
that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
24:48  "And
you are witnesses of these things.
24:49  x
"Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you;
but
tarry in the city of Jerusalem 
until 
you are endued with power from on high."
24:50  And
He led them out as far as Bethany,
and
He lifted up His hands 
and 
blessed them.
24:51  Now
it came to pass,
while
He blessed them,
that
He was parted from them 
and 
carried up into heaven.
24:52  And
they worshiped Him,
and
returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
24:53  and
were continually in the temple 
x
praising 
and 
blessing God.
x
Amen.
